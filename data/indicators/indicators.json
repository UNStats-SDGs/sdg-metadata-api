"},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"Monitoring poverty is important on the global development agenda as well as on the national development agenda of many countries. The World Bank produced its first global poverty estimates for developing countries for World Development Report 1990: Poverty (World Bank 1990) using household survey data for 22 countries (Ravallion, Datt, and van de Walle 1991). Since then there has been considerable expansion in the number of countries that field household income and expenditure surveys. The World Bank's Development Research Group maintains a database that is updated annually as new survey data become available (and thus may contain more recent data or revisions) and conducts a major reassessment of progress against poverty every year. PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows users to replicate these internationally comparable $1.90 and $3.10 a day global, regional and country-level poverty estimates and to compute poverty measures for custom country groupings and for different poverty lines. \r\nThe Poverty and Equity Data portal provides access to the database and user-friendly dashboards with graphs and interactive maps that visualize trends in key poverty and inequality indicators for different regions and countries. The country dashboards display trends in poverty measures based on the national poverty lines alongside the internationally comparable estimates, produced from and consistent with PovcalNet."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty, one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered appropriate for that country. But how do we talk meaningfully about \"global poverty?\" Poverty lines across countries vary in terms of their purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. But to consistently measure global absolute poverty in terms of consumption we need to treat two people with the same purchasing power over commodities the same way�both are either poor or not poor�even if they live in different countries.\r\nSince World Development Report 1990, the World Bank has aimed to apply a common standard in measuring extreme poverty, anchored to what poverty means in the world's poorest countries. The welfare of people living in different countries can be measured on a common scale by adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currencies. The commonly used $1 a day standard, measured in 1985 international prices and adjusted to local currency using PPPs, was chosen for World Development Report 1990 because it was typical of the poverty lines in low-income countries at the time. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated using new PPP price data to reflect these changes. The last change was in October 2015, when the World Bank adopted $1.90 as the international poverty line using the 2011 PPP. Prior to that, the 2008 update set the international poverty line at $1.25 using the 2005 PPP. Poverty measures based on international poverty lines attempt to hold the real value of the poverty line constant across countries, as is done when making comparisons over time. Early editions of the World Bank�s World Development Indicators (WDI) used PPPs from the Penn World Tables to convert values in local currency to equivalent purchasing power measured in U.S dollars. Later editions used 1993, 2005, and 2011 consumption PPP estimates produced by the World Bank�s International Comparison Program (ICP)."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Five countries � Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Jordan, and Laos � use the 2005 PPP conversion factors and corresponding $1.25 a day and $2 a day poverty lines. This is due to the large deviations in the rate of change in PPP factors relative to the rate of change in domestic consumer price indexes. See Box 1.1 in the Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016 (http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report) for a detailed explanation.\r\nDespite progress in the last decade, the challenges of measuring poverty remain. The timeliness, frequency, quality, and comparability of household surveys needs to increase substantially, particularly in the poorest countries. The availability and quality of poverty monitoring data remains low in small states, countries with fragile situations, and low-income countries and even some middle-income countries. The low frequency and lack of comparability of the data available in some countries create uncertainty over the magnitude of poverty reduction. \r\nBesides the frequency and timeliness of survey data, other data quality issues arise in measuring household living standards. The surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is generally more difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. And income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption data for about two-thirds of countries.\r\nHowever, even similar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing or in the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose a potential problem because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure but may not be. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"To measure poverty across countries consistently, the World Bank�s international measures apply a common standard, anchored to what \"poverty\" means in the world�s poorest countries. The original \"$1-a-day\" line was based on a compilation of national lines for only 22 developing countries, mostly from academic studies in the 1980s (Ravallion, et al., 1991). While this was the best that could be done at the time, the sample was hardly representative of developing countries even in the 1980s. Since then, national poverty lines have been developed for many other countries. Based on a new compilation of national lines for 75 developing countries, Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula (RCS) (2009) proposed a new international poverty line of $1.25 a day. This is the average poverty line for the poorest 15 countries in their data set. \r\nThe current extreme poverty line is set at $1.90 a day in 2011 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the national poverty lines found in the same poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption. The new poverty line maintains the same standard for extreme poverty - the poverty line typical of the poorest countries in the world - but updates it using the latest information on the cost of living in developing countries. \r\nWhen measuring international poverty of a country, the international poverty line at PPP is converted to local currencies in 2011 price and is then converted to the prices prevailing at the time of the relevant household survey using the best available Consumer Price Index (CPI). (Equivalently, the survey data on household consumption or income for the survey year are expressed in the prices of the ICP base year, and then converted to PPP $�s.) Then the poverty rate is calculated from that survey. All inter-temporal comparisons are real, as assessed using the country-specific CPI. Interpolation/extrapolation methods are used to line up the survey-based estimates with these reference years."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Work is underway at the World Bank for disaggregated poverty estimates."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"There is no \"imputation\" in the traditional sense for missing country data. However, to generate regional and global aggregates for reference years, country-level data are imputed for the years when surveys are not conducted. These imputed data are to be used for aggregation, but not for replacing the actual survey data. The subsequent section on the treatment of missing values at the regional and global levels provide more details on the imputation method."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"To compare the poverty rates across countries and compute regional aggregates, country estimates must be \"lined up\" first to a common reference year, interpolating for countries in which survey data are not available in the reference year but are available either before, after, or both. The more survey data are available (that is, the more data for different years), the more accurate the interpolation.\r\nThe process requires adjusting the mean income or expenditure observed in the survey year by a growth factor to infer the unobserved level in the reference year. Thus, two assumptions are required to implement this process: distribution-neutral growth and a real rate of growth between the survey and reference year.\r\nDistribution-neutral growth implies that income or expenditure levels are adjusted for growth assuming that the underlying relative distribution of income or expenditure observed in survey years remains unchanged. Under this assumption, it is straightforward to interpolate the poverty estimate in a given reference year implied by a given rate of growth in income or expenditure. Rates of change in real consumption per capita should be based on the change in real consumption measured by comparing country survey data across different years. In practice, however, survey data in most countries are not available on an annual basis. Therefore, the change in private consumption per capita as measured from the national accounts is used instead. While, there can be no guarantee that the survey-based measure of income or consumption change at exactly the same rate as private consumption in the national accounts, this appears to be the best available option.\r\nWhen the reference year falls between two survey years, an estimate of mean consumption at the reference year is constructed by extrapolating the means obtained from the surveys forward and backward to the reference year. The second step is to compute the headcount poverty rate at the reference year after normalizing the distributions observed in the two survey years by the reference year mean. This yields two estimates of the headcount poverty rates in the reference year. The final reported poverty headcount rate for the reference years is the linear interpolation of the two. When data from only one survey year are available, the reference year mean is based on the survey mean by applying the growth rate in private consumption per capita from the national accounts. The reference year poverty estimate is then based on this mean and on the distribution observed in the one survey year. The better data coverage is in terms of number and frequency of available surveys, the more accurate this lining-up process is and the more reliable the regional estimates will be.\r\nThe aggregate headcount ratio for a region is the population-weighted mean of the headcount indices across the countries in that region. The number of poor in each region is the product of the region�s headcount index and total regional population. This assumes that the poverty rate for a country without a household survey is the regional average."},"regional_aggregates":{"label":"Regional aggregates","content":"Because surveys are not conducted every year in most countries, poverty estimates have to be derived for line-up years by interpolation or extrapolation using national accounts data.

Based on the assumption that households pool their income, the question asked is whether a household�s total income is sufficient to ensure that it isn�t classified as being in poverty. The poverty status of a household is therefore a function of the wage and other employment-related income secured by those household members who work (plus any non-employment-related income such as transfer payments) and the number of household members. Whether a worker is counted as working poor therefore depends on his own income, the income of other household members and the number of household members � for example, children � who need to be supported.

The ASPIRE team harmonizes these household surveys to make them reasonably comparable across country and over time.\r\nThe ASPIRE harmonization methodology for household survey data rests on the following three steps:\r\n1. Identification and classification of Social Protection and Labor (SPL) benefits and services\r\nHousehold surveys are carefully reviewed to identify SPL program information. Once this information is located, two levels of analysis are implemented: first, variables are created for each of the country specific programs found in the survey. If the original program name is not provided in the survey instrument, the variable will report the corresponding ASPIRE�s program subcategories according to how the question is framed and country context.\r\nAdditionally, program variables are aggregated and harmonized into 12 SPL program categories, and 2 private transfer categories. The country specific programs included into these main SPL categories are documented in detail below and are validated with WB country task teams in close coordination with national counterparts.\r\nIn order to generate the indicators, the following variables are also harmonized: household identification number, location (urban/rural), household size, adult equivalent household size, welfare aggregate, household weight and poverty line, defined as the poorest 20% of the welfare distribution.\r\n2. Welfare aggregates\r\nHouseholds are ranked in quintiles of the welfare distribution (either household total income or consumption). Special efforts are made to include the most recently updated welfare aggregates officially agreed with National Statistical Offices and /or harmonized by regional poverty teams (or the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean - SEDLAC) in the case of Latin American countries and the ECAPOV database in the case of Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries. These welfare aggregates are also consistent with the ones used by World Bank PovcalNet poverty estimates.\r\n3. PPP conversions\r\nAll monetary variables (transfer amounts) and the welfare aggregate are deflated to 2005 values and then converted to international US Dollars according to the following: [all transfers and welfare (t) / CPI (2005)] / [ICP (2005)] where ICP (2005) is the PPP conversion factor base 2005 of private consumption.\r\nOnce the information is harmonized performance indicators are generated using ADePT SP software."}},"data_availability":{"description":{"label":"Description","content":"Data Availability 2010 to present (measured in terms of how many countries have at least 1 data point after 2010 for this indicator:\r\nAsia and Pacific: 19; Africa: 37; Latin America and Caribbean: 18; Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 15.\r\nData Availability (2000-2009)\r\nAsia and Pacific: 33; Africa: 37; Latin America and Caribbean: 22; Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 21"},"time_series":{"label":"Time series","content":"NA"}},"calendar":{"data_collection":{"label":"Data collection","content":"Ongoing process "},"data_release":{"label":"Data release","content":"Ongoing process"}},"partners":{"data_providers":{"label":"Data providers","content":"World Bank"},"data_compilers":{"label":"Data compilers","content":"World Bank"}},"references":{"url":{"label":"URL","content":"www.worldbank.org"},"other":{"label":"Other","content":"ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank (datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/)."}}}]},"1.5.1":{"goal_id":"1","target_id":"1.5","description":"Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people [a]","sources":[{"institutional_information":{"label":"Organization(s)","content":"United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)"},"concepts_and_definitions":{"definition":{"label":"Definition","content":"Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event\r\nMissing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event.

It is expressed as a percentage."},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"The indicator has been used by FAO to monitor the World Food Summit Target and the MDG Target 1C, at national, regional and global level, since 1999. It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy inadequacy in a population over time, generated as a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households� ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time.\r\nThe parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimated for relatively large population groups. As it reflects a severe condition of lack of food, it is fully consistent with the spirit of a Goal that aims at reducing hunger."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Undernourishment is defined as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. \r\nThough strictly related, \"undernourishment\" as defined here is different from the physical conditions of \"malnutrition\" and \"undernutrition\" as it refers to the condition of insufficient intake of food, rather than to the outcome in terms of nutritional status. In French, Spanish and Italian the difference is marked by the use of the terms alimentation, alimentaci�n, or alimentazione, instead of nutrition, nutrici�n or nutrizione, in the name of the indicator. A more appropriate expression in English that would render the precise meaning of the indicator might have been \"prevalence of under-feeding\" but by now the term \"undernourishment\" has long been associated with the indicator.\r\nWhile the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, due to conceptual and data-related considerations, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals. The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in a group that are in that condition, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Over the years, the parametric approach informing the computation of the PoU has been criticized, based on the presumptions that undernourishment should be assessed necessarily starting at the individual level, by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. According to such view, the prevalence of undernourishment could be simply computed by counting the number of individuals in a representative sample of the population that is classified as undernourished, based on a comparison of individual habitual food consumption and requirements. Unfortunately, such approach is not feasible for two reasons: first, due to the cost of individual dietary intake surveys, individual food consumption is measured only in a few countries, every several years, on relatively small samples; moreover, individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods (to the point that observed habitual energy consumption of individuals in a healthy status is still the preferred way to infer individual energy requirements). This means that even if it were possible to obtain accurate observations of the individual dietary energy consumption, this would be insufficient to infer on the undernourishment condition at individual level, unless integrated by the observation on the physical status (body mass index) and of its dynamic over time, of the same individual.\r\nThe model based approach to estimate the PoU developed by FAO integrates information that is available with sufficient regularity from different sources for most countries in the world, in a theoretically consistent way, thus providing what is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger.\r\nFurther specific consideration\r\n1. Feasibility\r\nEstimation of PoU at national level has been feasible for most countries in the world since 1999. In the worst case scenario, when no data on food consumption was available from a recent household survey, the model-based estimate of the PoU is informed by an estimate of mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC) from Food Balance Sheets (FBS), an indirect estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) based on information on the country�s GDP, Gini coefficient of Income, an index of the relative price of food, or other indicators of development such as country�s Under 5 Mortality Rate, and an estimate of the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) based on the UN Population Division�s World Population Prospects data.\r\n2. Reliability \r\nReliability mostly depends on the quality of the data used to inform the estimation of the model�s parameters.\r\nDEC could be estimated either from survey data or from food balances. Neither source is devoid of problems. When comparing estimates of national DEC from FBS and from surveys, differences are frequently noted. \r\nDEC estimates from survey data can be affected by systematic measurement errors due to under-reporting of food consumption, or to incomplete recording of all food consumption sources. Recent research shows that a negative bias of up to more than 850 kcal can be induced on the estimated daily per capita caloric consumption can be induced by the type of food consumption module chosen to capture the data at the household level. (See De Weerdt et al., 2015, Table 2, https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf ). A detailed analysis of a recent Household Budget Survey in Brazil revealed how food provided for free through the school meals program and consumed by children while at school, had not been accounted among the sources of household food consumption, accounting for a downward bias of the average per capita daily dietary energy consumption of 674 kcal. (See Borlizzi, Cafiero & Del Grossi, forthcoming.)\r\nDEC estimates from Food Balance Sheets can also be affected by errors, though it is difficult to establish the direction of induced bias. As average food availability is a residual in the FBS method, any errors in reported production, trade, and stocks might affect the estimates of national food availability. Moreover, errors might be induced by the difficulty in properly accounting for all forms of food commodity utilization. To the extent that all these errors are uncorrelated, though, the impact on the estimated average food consumption will be lower than each of the errors, considered separately, might imply. Nevertheless, considering how problematic it is to precisely account for variations in national reserves of food commodities, for which official data may be unreliable, it is recognized that the estimated annual stock variation is prone to considerable uncertainty that would be transferred to the estimated DEC in each given year. \r\nTo limit the impact of such errors, FAO has traditionally presented estimates of PoU at national level as three-year averages, on the presumption that errors induced by imprecise recording of stocks variations in each single year might be highly reduced when considering an average over three consecutive years.\r\nSurvey data are the only source to estimate the CV and Skewness. As described in the section of metadata on the method of computation, unless obtained from high quality individual dietary intake surveys, data needs to be treated to reduce the likely upward bias in the estimates of the CV that would be induced by the spurious variability due to errors in measuring individual habitual dietary energy intake.\r\n3. Comparability\r\nIf the same method of computation is used, comparability across time and space is relatively high, with the only potential cause of inhomogeneity found in the different quality of the background data.\r\n4. Limitations\r\nDue to the probabilistic nature of the inference and the margins of uncertainty associated with estimates of each of the parameters in the model, the precision of the PoU estimates is generally low. Even though it is not possible to compute theoretical Margins of Error (MoE) for PoU estimates, these would very likely exceed plus or minus 5% in most cases. For this reason, FAO publishes national level PoU estimates only when they are larger than 5%. This also suggests that 5% is the lowest feasible target that can be set for the PoU indicator, a value that is unsatisfactorily large when the ambition is to fully eradicate the scourge of hunger.\r\nIf no survey is available that collects food consumption data and that is representative at subnational level, the indicator can only be computed at national level.\""}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"The indicator is computed at the population level. To this aim, the population is represented by an \"average\" individual for which a probability distribution of the habitual daily dietary energy intake levels is modelled through a parametric probability density function (pdf).\r\nOnce the pdf is characterized, the indicator is obtained as the cumulative probability that daily habitual dietary energy intakes (x) are below the lower bound of the range of normal dietary energy requirements for that representative, or average individual (MDER), as in the formula below:\r\nPoU= <U+222B>_(x<MDER) f(x | DEC; CV; Skew) dx\r\nwhere DEC, CV and Skew are the mean, coefficient of variation and skewness that characterize the distribution of habitual dietary energy consumption levels in the population. \r\nUntil 2012, the probability distribution f(x) was modelled as a Log-normal pdf, informed by only two parameters: mean and coefficient of variation. In its most recent formulation, it is modelled as a three-parameter pdf, able to represent different degrees of skewness, ranging from that of a symmetric Normal distribution to that of the positively skewed Log-normal distribution. The flexibility in capturing different degrees of skewness is needed to take into account the fact that human energy consumption levels are naturally bounded by physiological limits. It is thus conceivable that, as mean consumption levels increases, the skewness of the distribution decreases, gradually moving from (positively skewed) Log-normal distributions, typical of populations where average food consumption is relatively low, towards (symmetric) Normal distributions. The skew-normal and skew-lognormal families of distribution allow for the characterization of all possible intermediate degrees of positive skewness. (See http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf for a detailed description)\r\nA custom R function is available from the Statistics Division at FAO to compute the PoU, given the four parameters DEC, CV, Skew and MDER.\r\nDifferent data sources can be used to estimate the different parameters of the model.\r\nDEC\r\nThe mean of the distribution of dietary energy consumption levels for the average individual in a population (DEC) corresponds, by definition, to the average, daily per capita food consumption level in the population.\r\nDEC can be estimated from data on food consumption obtained through surveys that are representative of the population of interest. Depending on the survey design, they can be used to estimate DEC at national and at sub national levels, either by geographic areas or by socio-economic population groups. Unfortunately, though the situation is rapidly improving, representative surveys that collect food consumption data are still not available for every country and every year. \r\nFor the national population only, DEC can be estimated also from accounts of the total supply and utilization of all food commodities in a country, where the contribution of each commodity to the availability of food for human consumption is expressed in their dietary energy content, and their total is divided by the size of the population. The major source of data on national food balances are the Food Balance Sheets (FBS) maintained by FAO for most countries in the world (see http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en/), informed by official data reported by member countries, and disseminated through FAOSTAT (http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/*/E )\r\nCV\r\nSurveys that contain information on food consumption at individual or household level are the only available source to directly estimate the CV of habitual food consumption for the representative individual in the population. Unfortunately, survey data on food consumption are fraught by many problems that complicate the reliable estimation of CV.\r\nIn principle, repeated observations of daily consumption for each individual in a sample would be needed to estimate levels of habitual consumption and to control for measurement errors. Moreover, data should be collected in different periods of the year on the same individuals or households to account for possible seasonal variation in levels of dietary energy consumption. Due to their cost, nationally representative individual dietary intake surveys with such characteristics are very rare, and virtually inexistent for most developing countries. As a consequence, the most common sources of data to estimate CV are multipurpose household surveys, such as Living Standard Measurement Surveys, Household Incomes and Expenditure Surveys (or Household Budgets Survey), that collect also information on food consumption. When using data collected at household level however, careful attention should be taken in distinguishing levels of food purchases or acquisitions from levels of actual utilization (consumption and wastage) during the identified reference period and in properly recording the number of individuals who participate in consumption; moreover, household level data will mask the variability due to intra-household allocation of food. \r\nFor all these reasons, the coefficient of variation calculated on the series of average per capita daily dietary energy consumption levels recorded for each household included in a survey is never a reliable estimate of CV, which should reflect variability in the levels of habitual (and not occasional) daily dietary energy consumption level, at the individual (and not household) level. Empirical estimates of CV from household survey data are upward biased due to the spurious variability induced by measurement error, differences between occasional and habitual consumption, differences between acquisition and actual consumption and seasonality; moreover, they do not reflect the variability in dietary energy consumption in the population associated with individual characteristics of the household members (such as sex, age, body mass and physical activity levels).\r\nWhen using data collected through household surveys, CV is thus best estimated indirectly, controlling for spurious variability, and adjusted to reflect inter-individuals (in addition to inter-households) variability. The simplest way to proceed is to classify households into homogeneous groups and to calculate the coefficient of variation of the average per capita dietary energy consumption across household groups. This yields an estimate of the inter-households component of CV, labelled CV_H. An estimate of the inter-individuals component of the CV, labelled CV_I, is obtained, for each population, from its structure by sex, age and body masses, and the two components are combined to obtain the needed estimate as:\r\nCV^ = v[(CV_H)^2+(CV_I)^2 )].\r\nFor countries and years when no data from household survey are available, an indirect estimate of the CV, CV_IND, is obtained via a regression that projects the values of per capita GDP, Gini coefficient of income, and an index of the relative price of food (FPI) on the CV, while controlling for a regional shifter (REG).\r\nCV^_IND=�_0+�_1 GDP+ �_2 GINI+ �_3 FPI+�_4 REG.\r\nCoefficients of the regression are estimated from the set of data and years for which data on CV, GDP, GINI and FPI are available.\r\nSkew\r\nAs skewness is not strongly affected by the presence of spurious variability, Skew is estimated directly from household level data on the average daily dietary consumption, with the only exception of eliminating rare extremely high or extremely low values. If the empirically estimated skewness exceeds the value that would correspond to the skewness of Log-normal distribution with given mean and coefficient of variation, the parameter is neglected and a two parameter lognormal distribution is used for f(x). (See http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4046e.pdf for additional details).\r\nMDER\r\nHuman energy requirements are computed by multiplying normative requirements for basic metabolic rate (BMR, expressed per kg of body mass) by the ideal weight of a healthy person of given height, and then multiplied by a coefficient of physical activity level (PAL). Ranges of normal energy requirements are thus computed for each sex and age group of the population, observing that there exist a whole range of Body Mass Index (BMI) values � from 18.5 to 25 � that are compatible with health. This implies that any given attained height might correspond to a whole range of healthy body weights, and therefore to a range of values for energy requirement for BMR.\r\nGiven information on the median height and the consideration that the group might contain individuals engaged in different levels of physical activity, the minimum, average and maximum dietary energy requirement can be computed for every sex and age class by taking into consideration special allowances for growth in individuals aged 0-21 and for pregnancy and lactation. \r\n(See ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y5686e/y5686e00.pdf for further details). \r\nThe MDER for a given population group, including for the national population, is obtained as the weighted average of the minimums of the energy requirements ranges of each sex and age class, using the population size in each class as weights.\r\nIn computing the prevalence of dietary energy inadequacy in a population there has often been confusion between the concept of MDER and that of the Recommended Dietary Energy Intake, and regarding the appropriate threshold to be used to compute the probability of inadequacy. The reason why the probability of dietary energy inadequacy should be computed with reference to the MDER, and not the ADER (which, instead, can be used as an estimate of the average recommended dietary intake level for the whole population) is simply to recognize the fact that in any population there exists a certain range of normal variability in requirements; using the ADER as a threshold would greatly overestimate undernourishment as it would count also the proportion of the healthy population that consumes less than average, simply because of having less than average requirements. When needed, the ADER, or the average Recommended Dietary Energy Intake level in a population must be used instead to compute the dietary energy gap.\""},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Due to reliance on national Food Balance Sheets data to estimate mean caloric consumption levels in the population, the global monitoring of MDG Target 1C and of the WFS target has been based on estimates of the PoU at national level only.\r\nIn principle, the indicator can be computed for any specific population group, provided sufficient accurate information exists to characterize the model�s parameters for that specific group, that is, if data on the group�s food consumption levels, age/gender structure and � possibly � physical activity levels, exist. \r\nThe scope for disaggregation thus crucially depends on the availability of surveys designed to be representative at the level of sub national population groups. Given prevailing practice in the design of national household surveys, sufficient reliable information is seldom available for disaggregation beyond the level of macro area of residence (urban-rural) and of the main Provinces/Divisions in a country. To the extent that most of the used surveys are designed to accurately capture the distribution of income, inference can be drawn on the PoU in different income classes of the population.

In some cases, also lower thresholds of around 1,400.00 kcal have been used, probably as a reaction to the fact that percentages of households reporting average daily consumption of less than 2,100.00 kcal per capita were implausibly high estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment. \r\nAlmost without exception, no consideration related to the presence of excess variability in the dietary energy consumption data is made, and the reports reveal limited or no progress in the reduction of PoU over time. \r\nAs discussed in the section on the method of computation, the results obtained through these alternative methods are highly unreliable and almost certainly biased toward overestimation.

Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2 per cent to C�s GDP, and 10 per cent to country D�s GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.\r\nThe AOI index takes into account a country�s economic size, Agriculture�s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditures. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target.

Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death.\r\nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account.\r\nBecause maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross-country or over-time comparisons.\r\nTo reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy-related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio.\r\nCensuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success.\r\nReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify maternal deaths; no single source identifies all the deaths. Interviews with household members and health-care providers and reviews of facility records are used to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise. If properly conducted, this approach provides a fairly complete estimation of maternal mortality (in the absence of reliable routine registration systems) and could provide subnational MMRs. However, inadequate identification of all deaths of reproductive-aged women results in underestimation of maternal mortality levels. This approach can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive to undertake � particularly on a large scale. The number of live births used in the computation may not be accurate, especially in settings where most women deliver at home. \r\nWHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data.\r\nData on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation.\r\nCurrently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country-reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories � those with no appropriate maternal mortality data -- a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins within which the true levels are known to lie.\r\nDetails on adjustments and formulas are published/available here:\r\n(1) http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/194254/1/9789241565141_eng.pdf?ua=1\r\n (2) Alkema L, Chou D, Hogan D, Zhang S, Moller A, Gemmill A et al.

However, to account for potential incompleteness of death recording in various data sources, the MMEIG first computes the fraction of deaths due to maternal causes from original data sources (referred to as the \"proportion maternal\", or PM), and then applies that fraction to WHO estimates of total deaths among women of reproductive age to obtain an estimate of the number of maternal deaths. \r\nIn other words, the following fraction is first computed from country data sources:\r\nPM= Number of maternal deaths 15-49/All female deaths at ages 15-49 \r\nand then the PM is used to compute the MMR as follows:\r\nMMR=PM �(All female deaths at ages 15-49/Number of live births)\r\nwhere the estimate of all deaths at ages 15-49 in the second equation is derived from WHO life tables, and the number of live births is from the World Population Prospects 2015.\r\nWith this as background, a few reasons that MMEIG estimates may differ from national statistics are as follows:\r\n1. Civil registration and vital statistics systems are not always complete (i.e., they do not always capture 100% of all deaths) and completeness may change over time. The MMEIG estimation approach attempts to correct for this by using the above approach, which involves first computing the PM.\r\n2. The MMEIG often applies adjustment factors to the PM computed from original data to account for measurement issues (such as how the country defined \"maternal\" deaths; misclassification; or undercounting). \r\n3. The MMEIG uses the standardized series of live births from the United Nations Population Division, as published in World Population Prospects 2015, in the denominator of the MMR equation. To better inform the WPP, countries should discuss discrepancies directly with the UNPD. The contact address is population@un.org; this email address is monitored regularly and messages are dispatched to the appropriate analysts for each country or concern. \r\n4. Statistically speaking, maternal deaths are a relatively rare event, which can lead to noisy time trends in data over time. As the goal of the MMEIG estimates is to track long term progress in reducing maternal mortality, the estimation process involves some smoothing to generate a curve that better captures changes in underlying risk"}},"data_sources":{"description":{"label":"Description","content":"Please see page 5 of the report\r\nhttp://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/194254/1/9789241565141_eng.pdf?ua=1"},"list":{"label":"List","content":"NA"},"collection_process":{"label":"Collection process","content":"The MMEIG maintains an input database consisting of maternal mortality data from civil registration, population based surveys, surveillance systems, censuses, and other specialized studies/surveys.

The MMR is then calculated as MMR = PM(D/B); where \"D\" is the number of deaths in women aged 15-49 (WRA) and \"B\" is the number of live births. The number of live births is based upon the World Population Prospects.\r\nStatistical modelling is undertaken to generate comparable Country, Regional, and Global level estimates. The model's fit is assessed by cross-validation. Estimates are then reviewed with Member States through a WHO country consultation process. In 2001, the WHO Executive Board endorsed a resolution (EB.107.R8) seeking to \"establish a technical consultation process bringing together personnel and perspectives from Member States in different WHO regions\". A key objective of this consultation process is \"to ensure that each Member State is consulted on the best data to be used\". Since the process is an integral step in the overall estimation strategy, it is described here in brief.\r\nThe country consultation process entails an exchange between WHO and technical focal person(s) in each country. It is carried out prior to the publication of estimates. During the consultation period, WHO invites focal person(s) to review input data sources, methods for estimation and the preliminary estimates. Focal person(s) are encouraged to submit additional data that may not have been taken into account in the preliminary estimates.\r\nAdjustments are made according to the data source type:\r\n(1) CRVS, for underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths\r\n(2) reports providing \"pregnancy-related\" mortality, for underreporting of these deaths, as well as over-reporting of maternal deaths due to inclusion of deaths which are accidental or incidental to pregnancy (thus outside of the definition of maternal mortality). \r\nThe analysis also accounts for stochastic errors due to the general rarity of maternal deaths, sampling error in the data source, errors during data collection and processing, and other random error."}},"data_availability":{"description":{"label":"Description","content":"The MMR estimates is limited to countries with population of greater than 100 000.

The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates. The UN IGME applies the Bayesian B-splines bias-reduction model to empirical data to derive trend estimates of under-five mortality for countries. The infant mortality rate (IMR) is obtained by either applying the B3 estimation method or by applying a model life table to the U5MR estimates. For countries with high-quality VR data (covering a sufficient period of time and deemed to have high levels of completeness and coverage), the B3 model is used. For the remaining countries, the IMR is derived from the U5MR, through the use of model life tables that contain known regularities in age patterns of child mortality.

Countries often use one single source as their official estimates or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.\r\nMany countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of infant mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Also the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality.

Countries often use one single source as their official estimates or apply methods different from the UN IGME methods to derive estimates. The differences between the UN IGME estimates and national official estimates are usually not large if empirical data has good quality.\r\nMany countries lack a single source of high-quality data covering the last several decades. Data from different sources require different calculation methods and may suffer from different errors, for example random errors in sample surveys or systematic errors due to misreporting. As a result, different surveys often yield widely different estimates of neonatal mortality for a given time period and available data collected by countries are often inconsistent across sources. It is important to analyse, reconcile and evaluate all data sources simultaneously for each country. Each new survey or data point must be examined in the context of all other sources, including previous data. Data suffer from sampling or non-sampling errors (such as misreporting of age and survivor selection bias; underreporting of child deaths is also common). UN IGME assesses the quality of underlying data sources and adjusts data when necessary. Also the latest data produced by countries often are not current estimates but refer to an earlier reference period. Thus, the UN IGME also projects estimates to a common reference year. In order to reconcile these differences and take better account of the systematic biases associated with the various types of data inputs, the UN IGME has developed an estimation method to fit a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and to extrapolate that trend to a defined time point. The UN IGME aims to minimize the errors for each estimate, harmonize trends over time and produce up-to-date and properly assessed estimates of child mortality. In the absence of error-free data, there will always be uncertainty around data and estimates, both national and interagency. To allow for added comparability, the UN IGME generates such estimates with uncertainty bounds. Applying a consistent methodology also allows for comparisons between countries, despite the varied number and types of data sources. UN IGME applies a common methodology across countries and uses original empirical data from each country but does not report figures produced by individual countries using other methods, which would not be comparable to other country estimates."}},"data_sources":{"description":{"label":"Description","content":"Nationally-representative estimates of child mortality can be derived from a number of different sources, including civil registration and sample surveys. Demographic surveillance sites and hospital data are excluded as they are rarely representative. The preferred source of data is a civil registration system which records births and deaths on a continuous basis. If registration is complete and the system functions efficiently, the resulting estimates will be accurate and timely. However, many countries do not have well-functioning vital registration systems. In such cases household surveys, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and periodic population censuses have become the primary source of data on under-five and neonatal mortality. These surveys ask women about the survival of their children, and it is these reports that provide the basis of child mortality estimates for a majority of low- and middle- income countries. These data, however, are often subject to sampling or/and non-sampling errors, which might be substantial.\r\nCivil registration\r\nCivil registration data are the preferred data source for under-five, infant and neonatal mortality estimation. The calculation of neonatal mortality rates are derived from the number of neonatal deaths and number of births over a period. For civil registration data (with available data on the number of deaths and mid-year populations), initially annual observations were constructed for all observation years in a country.\r\nPopulation census and household survey data\r\nThe majority of survey data comes from the full birth history (FBH), whereby women are asked for the date of birth of each of their children, whether the child is still alive, and if not the age at death."},"list":{"label":"List","content":"NA"},"collection_process":{"label":"Collection process","content":"For neonatal mortality, UNICEF and the UN IGME compile data from all available data sources, including household surveys, censuses, vital registration data etc. UNICEF and the UN IGME compile these data whenever they are available publically and then conduct data quality assessment.

UNICEF also collects vital registration data reported by the Ministry of Health to WHO. \r\nAdjustments of empirical data are made in high prevalence HIV settings to adjust for under reporting of child mortality due to missing mothers in survey data. UN IGME than applies a curve fitting method to these empirical data to derive the UN IGME trend estimates of the neonatal mortality rates. Because deaths by crisis are difficult to capture in household survey or census data UN IGME adjusts the neonatal mortality estimates for crisis mortality.\r\nThen the UN IGME conducts a country consultation by sending the UN IGME estimates, empirical data used to derive the UN IGME estimates, notes on methodology etc. to National Statistical Office through UNICEF and to Ministry of Health through WHO for feedback on the UN IGME estimates and the empirical data. National Statistical Office and Ministry of Health review the UN IGME estimates and empirical data and send feedback or comments and sometimes additional empirical data if these data are not included in the UN IGME database.\r\nTo increase the transparency of the estimation process, the UN IGME has developed a child mortality database: CME Info (www.childmortality.org).

The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys.\r\nWith respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20�24 years. \r\nThe adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates.

A related measure is the proportion of adolescent fertility measured as the percentage of total fertility contributed by women aged 15-19."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"The adolescent birth rate is computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The computation is the same for the age group 10-14 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data.\r\nIn the case of civil registration data, the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.\r\nIn the case of survey data, the numerator is the number of live births obtained from retrospective birth histories of the interviewed women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the births during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator is person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.\r\nWith census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under-registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census.\r\nIf data are available, adolescent fertility at ages 10-14 years can also be computed. \r\nFor a thorough treatment of the different methods of computation, see Handbook on the Collection of Fertility and Mortality Data, United Nations Publication, Sales No. E.03.XVII.11, (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/SeriesF/SeriesF_92E.pdf).

In several regions, however, household air pollution remains mainly a rural issue, while ambient air pollution is predominantly an urban problem. Also, in some continents, many countries are relatively unaffected by household air pollution, while ambient air pollution is a major concern.

One option is to link existing regional assessments based on a common framework. Furthermore, assessments are typically administered within school systems, the current indicators cover only those in school and the proportion of in-school target populations might vary from country to country due to varied out-of-school children populations. Assessing competencies of children and young people who are out of school would require household-based surveys. Assessing children in households is under consideration but may be very costly and difficult to administer and unlikely to be available on the scale needed within the next 3-5 years. Finally, the calculation of this indicator requires specific information on the ages of children participating in assessments to create globally-comparable data. The ages of children reported by the head of the household might not be consistent and reliable so the calculation of the indicator may be even more challenging. Due to the complication in assessing out-of-school children and the main focus on improving education system, the UIS is taking a stepping stone approach.

Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children�s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation. \r\nThe official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies.

UNESCO has been analyzing the survey results and reports to its General Conference on country status. During the 5th and latest consultation (2009-2012) of the 1974 Recommendation, 57 national reports were submitted to UNESCO. The statutory monitoring responsibility for 1974 Recommendation is the most important and relevant data collection mechanism that is already in place for this indicator as it covers all key conceptual aspects of GCED and ESD, including climate change education, especially in the areas of policy, curricula, teacher education and student assessment, which correspond exactly to the areas covered by this indicator. As per the request from the Executive Board, UNESCO revised the terminologies and the format of the survey tool to make it more relevant to the present time and easy to use, which will increase the response rate. The revised guidelines for reporting, including a questionnaire, were approved by the 199th Session of the Executive Board and it will be used for the data collection exercise launched in June 2016, due by end of 2016. Analysis of the past reports will also allow a time series review of the countries� support for GCED. \r\nSalient guiding principles on sources and collection approaches as well as experiences on this topic can be derived from the global monitoring and evaluation work conducted as part of the decade for education for sustainable development (DESD, 2005-2014).

A computer is a programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve and process data, as well as share information in a highly-structured manner. It performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations according to a set of instructions or algorithms. Computers include the following types:\r\n- A desktop computer usually remains fixed in one place; normally the user is placed in front of it, behind the keyboard;\r\n- A laptop computer is small enough to carry and usually enables the same tasks as a desktop computer; it includes notebooks and netbooks but does not include tablets and similar handheld devices; and\r\n- A tablet (or similar handheld computer) is a computer that is integrated into a flat touch screen, operated by touching the screen rather than using a physical keyboard.\r\nAdapted infrastructure is defined as any built environment related to education facilities that are accessible to all users, including those with different types of disability, to be able to gain access to use and exit from them.

Government funds should be earmarked for that purpose and channelled through a specific body (fund). \r\nMonitoring: This proxy aims to identify any policy objectives, draft provisions, existing legal provisions and implementing legislation that commit the government to the creation and maintenance of a fund for women�s access to land and/or access to productive resources and services.\r\nProxy b)\r\nTitle: Is joint titling of private property compulsory or encouraged through economic incentives for married or unmarried couples, in accordance with national law?\r\nRationale: Legal provisions on joint ownership of private property are not always a guarantee of women�s equal rights to land ownership or control.

The JMP developed the metric of use of �improved� sanitation facilities, which are likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact, and has used this indicator to track progress towards the MDG target since 2000. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, acceptability, and safety. Furthermore, the safe management of faecal wastes should be considered, as discharges of untreated wastewater into the environment create public health hazards.\r\nThe above consultation concluded that post-2015 targets, which apply to all countries, should go beyond the basic level of access and address indicators of safe management of sanitation services, including dimensions of accessibility, acceptability and safety. The Expert Working Group called for analysis of faecal waste management along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying of latrines and septic tanks, and safe on-site disposal or transport of wastes to designated treatment sites. Classification of treatment will be based on categories defined by SEEA and the International Recommendations for Water Statistics and following a laddered approach (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment).\r\nHandwashing with soap is widely agreed to be the top hygiene priority for improving health outcomes. In 2008 and 2009, the JMP supported a review of indicators of handwashing practice, and determined that the most practical approach leading to reliable measurement of handwashing in national household surveys was observation of the place where household members wash their hands and noting the presence of water and soap (or local alternative) at that location. This provides a measure of whether households have the necessary tools for handwashing and is a proxy for their behaviour. Observation by survey enumerators represents a more reliable, valid and efficient indicator for measuring handwashing behaviour than asking individuals to report their own behaviour."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Improved sanitation facilities include the following: flush or pour flush toilets to sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with a slab, and composting toilets.\r\nSafely disposed in situ; when pit latrines and septic tanks are not emptied, the excreta may still remain isolated from human contact and can be considered safely managed. For example, with the new SDG indicator, households that use twin pit latrines or safely abandon full pit latrines and dig new facilities, a common practice in rural areas, would be counted as using safely managed sanitation services.\r\nTreated offsite; not all excreta from toilet facilities conveyed in sewers (as wastewater) or emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks (as faecal sludge) reaches a treatment plant. For instance, a portion may leak from the sewer itself or, due to broken pumping installations, be discharged directly to the environment. Similarly, a portion of the faecal sludge emptied from containers may be discharged into open drains, to open ground or water bodies, rather than being transported to a treatment plant. And finally, even once the excreta reaches a treatment plant a portion may remain untreated, due to dysfunctional treatment equipment or inadequate treatment capacity, and be discharged to the environment. For the purposes of SDG monitoring, adequacy of treatment will be assessed through consideration of both the overall treatment effectiveness and end-use/disposal arrangements.\r\nA handwashing facility with soap and water: a handwashing facility is a device to contain, transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing.

Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity."},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in regard to \"withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity\", i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4.\r\nThe indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country�s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. \r\nTotal renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms \"water resources\" and \"water withdrawal\" are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. \r\nInternal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. \r\n.\r\nExternal renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. \r\nTotal freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater, such as discharged wastewater and agricultural drainage water) and fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. \r\nEnvironmental water requirements (Env.) are the quantities of water required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. Water quality and also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not important and should not be taken care of. Methods of computation of Env. are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water volumes can be expressed in the same units as the TWW, and then as percentages of the available water resources."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Water withdrawal as a percentage of water resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. \r\nSupplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator and there is no universal consensus on such threshold. \r\nTrends in water withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. \r\nEstimation of water withdrawal by sector is the main limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water use data on a regular basis by sector. \r\nRenewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable water resources.\r\nThere is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country's borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. \r\nOther limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: \r\n� difficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; \r\n� potentially large variation of sub-national data; \r\n� lack of account of seasonal variations in water resources;\r\n� lack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; \r\n� lack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and\r\n� the indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to the system), non-renewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the water set aside for environmental water requirements. \r\nSome of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the index at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"Method of computation: The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental water requirements (Env.), multiplied by 100.

As water issues, and water management issues in particular, cut across a wide number of sectors, often overseen by different ministries and other administrative bodies at national or other levels, the process should be inclusive. Major stakeholders should be involved in order to contribute to well informed and objective answers to the questionnaire. \r\nThe ministry may wish to nominate a national \"IWRM focal point\", who may or may not be a government official.

It should also be noted that the following steps represent a �ladder� approach, in that completing all the steps will generally lead to a more robust indicator. However, it may not be possible or necessary for all countries to complete all steps. \r\n1) The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point contacts other relevant ministries/agencies to compile responses to the questionnaire. Each possible response option has a score which will be used to calculate the overall indicator score, \r\n2) The completed draft questionnaire is reviewed by government stakeholders. These stakeholders could include those involved in water-relevant sectors, such as agriculture, energy, water supply and environment, as well as water management at different administrative levels. This process may be electronic (e.g. via email) and/or through workshops. \r\n3) The revised draft questionnaire is validated at a multi-stakeholder workshop. Apart from government representatives these stakeholders could include water user associations, private sector, interest groups concerned with e.g. environment, agriculture, poverty, and academia. The suggested process is through a workshop but alternative means of consultation e.g. email, online call for public submissions could be considered. Note that steps 2 and 3 could be combined if desired. \r\n4) The responsible ministry or IWRM focal point discusses with relevant officials and consolidates the input into a final version. This version will be the basis for calculating the degree of IWRM implementation (0-100) for global reporting. Countries can enter responses electronically into an online version of the survey, which will automatically calculate the degree of IWRM implementation score, and also generate graphs and automatic reports to help countries identify areas for attention. \r\n5) The responsible ministry submits the final indicator score to the national statistics office responsible for compiling all national SDG target data. \r\nBased on the national survey, UN-Water will periodically prepare synthesis reports for regional and global levels to provide overall progress on meeting SDG target 6.5. \r\nTemporal Coverage: A reporting cycle of three years is recommended."},"list":{"label":"List","content":"NA"},"collection_process":{"label":"Collection process","content":"Official counterparts at the country level and the validation and consultation process. \r\nThe survey has been designed so that the indicator is comparable between countries and time periods.

ODA is defined as flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 per cent (using a fixed 10 per cent rate of discount). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (\"bilateral ODA\") and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts, from a recipient perspective, comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions. Lending by export credit agencies�with the pure purpose of export promotion�is excluded (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm).\r\n\"Developing countries\" refer to countries, which are eligible to receive official development assistance (see http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/daclist.htm).

Total water and sanitation-related ODA will continue to be reported as an additional indicator going forward.\r\nIn addition, the proportion of ODA channelled through the government treasury will be reported as an additional indicator. ODA channelled through treasury indicates a high level of cooperation and alignment between donors and national government in which the donors channel funds through the national budget process. \r\nThe OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS) currently disaggregates ODA for the water and sanitation among several categories including: sector policy and administration, water resources protection, large and basic water and sanitation systems, river basin infrastructure, waste management, agricultural water resources, and education and training. While these categories do not align directly with the target areas of SDG 6 individually, which limits the disaggregation of ODA among the SDG target areas, the combined ODA from these categories does align with a majority of the reported ODA to the water sector.\r\nAs the numerator and denominator come from different sources, there is the possibility of different underlying assumptions regarding what should be included/excluded in the ODA figures. This could lead to situations in which the proportion of ODA included in government budget is greater than 1 (100%) if total ODA reported to OECD is lower than ODA reported to be included the budget. To guard against this possibility, the OECD will supply GLAAS with the reported ODA figures, broken down to the project level, so that respondents can match these with their on-budget project data. \r\nODA represents only one aspect of international cooperation.

For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General�s Sustainable Energy for All initiative."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Current global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking, categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.\r\nNew evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits.\r\nFor this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as \"access to clean fuels and technologies\" rather than \"access to non-solid fuels.\" This shift will help ensure that health and other \"nexus\" benefits are better counted, and thus realized."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"The indicator uses the type of primary fuels and technologies used for cooking, heating, and lighting as a practical surrogate for estimating human exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and its related disease burden, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However epidemiological studies provide a science-based evidence for establishing those estimates using these surrogates.\r\nThe indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel and stove for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with polluting fuels can also be a contributor to household (indoor) air pollution levels. In addition, lighting with kerosene, a very polluting and hazardous fuel is also often used, and in some countries is the main fuel used for cooking.\r\nWhile the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access for cooking fuel, it also presents a number of limitations that will need to be addressed over time. Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the type of fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. Accordingly WHO in cooperation with World Bank, and the Global Alliance for Clean Cook stoves, is leading a survey enhancement process with representatives from country statistical offices and national household surveying agencies (e.g. Demographic and Health Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Living Standards Measurement Survey) to better gather efficiently and harmoniously information on the fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. This process is currently in the piloting phase with expected rollout of the final household surveys questions (~6 questions in total) expected in the coming year. These few questions will replace and slightly expand the current set of questions commonly used on national multipurpose surveys to assess household energy.\r\nSubstantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7 and harnesses the normative guidance in the WHO guidelines to benchmark tiers of energy access. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field.

These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste.

There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge.\r\n� Off-grid renewables data is limited and not sufficiently captured in the energy statistics\r\n� The method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas from consumption centers and may incur larger losses.\r\n� Likewise, imports and exports of electricity and heat are assumed to follow the share of renewability of electricity and heat generation, respectively. This is a simplification that in many cases will not affect the indicator too much, but that might do so in some cases, for example, when a country only generates electricity from fossil fuels but imports a great share of the electricity it uses from a neighboring country�s hydroelectric power plant.\r\n� Methodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, page 194-200."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"It is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption.

Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively.

The validation procedure involves ensuring that aggregates are equal to the sum of their components and that data series which are provided in multiple tables are represented consistently.

When these conversion rates are not available other IMF rates are used (official rates or principal rates).\r\nFor countries whose exchange rates are not reported by the IMF, the annual average of United Nations operational rates of exchange (UNOPs) is applied. The UNOPs are conversion rates that are applied in official transactions of the United Nations with these countries. These exchange rates are based on official, commercial and/or tourist rates of exchange.\r\nIn cases where a country experiences considerable distortion in the conversion rates, the UNSD uses price-adjusted rates of exchange (PARE) as an alternative to the exchange rates reported by the IMF or UN operational rates of exchange. The conversion based on PARE corrects the distorting effects of uneven price changes that are not well reflected in the other conversion rates.

Shared prosperity explicitly recognizes that while growth is necessary for improving economic welfare in a society, progress is measured by how those gains are shared with its poorest members. Moreover, in an inclusive society it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an absolute minimum standard of living; it must ensure that economic growth increases prosperity among the poor over time.\r\nThe decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken to ignore the many other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measure�though measurement challenges exist. Indeed, shared prosperity comprises many dimensions of well-being of the less well-off, and when analyzing shared prosperity in the context of a country, it is important to consider a wide range of indicators of welfare."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Promoting shared prosperity is defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in every country and is measured by calculating the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent. The choice of the bottom 40 percent as the target population is one of practical compromise. The bottom 40 percent differs across countries depending on the welfare distribution, and it can change over time within a country. Because boosting shared prosperity is a country-specific goal, there is no numerical target defined globally."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"There are mainly two limitations of shared prosperity indicators: data availability and data quality. \r\nData availability\r\nLack of household survey data is even more problematic for monitoring shared prosperity than for monitoring poverty. To monitor shared prosperity, two surveys of a country have to be conducted within five years or so during a chosen period, namely circa 2007-12. They have to be reasonably comparable to each other in terms of both the survey design and the construction of the welfare aggregates. Thus, not every survey that can generate poverty estimates can generate shared prosperity estimates. \r\nThe second consideration is the coverage of countries, with data that are as recent as possible. Since shared prosperity must be estimated and used at the country level, there are good reasons for obtaining a wide coverage of countries, regardless of the size of their population. Moreover, for policy purposes it is important to have indicators for the most recent period possible for each country. The selection of survey years and countries needs to be made consistently and transparently, achieving a balance between matching the time period as closely as possible across all countries, including the most recent data, and ensuring the widest possible coverage of countries, across regions and income levels. In practice, this means that time periods will not match perfectly across countries. This is a compromise: while it introduces a degree of incomparability, it also creates a database that includes a larger set of countries than would be otherwise possible \r\nData quality\r\nLike for poverty rates, estimates of annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption are based on income or consumption data collected in household surveys. The same quality issues applying to poverty rates apply here. Specifically, measuring household living standards has its own complications. Surveys ask detailed questions on sources of income and how it was spent, which must be carefully recorded by trained personnel. Income is difficult to measure accurately, and consumption comes closer to the notion of living standards. Moreover, income can vary over time even if living standards do not. But consumption data are not always available: the latest estimates reported here use consumption for about two-thirds of countries.\r\nSimilar surveys may not be strictly comparable because of differences in timing, sampling frames, or the quality and training of enumerators. Comparisons of countries at different levels of development also pose problems because of differences in the relative importance of the consumption of nonmarket goods. The local market value of all consumption in kind (including own production, particularly important in underdeveloped rural economies) should be included in total consumption expenditure, but in practice are often not. Most survey data now include valuations for consumption or income from own production, but valuation methods vary.\r\nThe statistics reported here are based on consumption data or, when unavailable, on income data. Analysis of some 20 countries for which both consumption and income data were available from the same surveys found income to yield a higher mean than consumption but also higher inequality. When poverty measures based on consumption and income were compared, the two effects roughly cancelled each other out: there was no significant statistical difference. \r\nInvariably some sampled households do not participate in surveys because they refuse to do so or because nobody is at home during the interview visit. This is referred to as \"unit nonresponse\" and is distinct from \"item nonresponse,\" which occurs when some of the sampled respondents participate but refuse to answer certain questions, such as those pertaining to income or consumption. To the extent that survey nonresponse is random, there is no concern regarding biases in survey-based inferences; the sample will still be representative of the population. However, households with different incomes may not be equally likely to respond. Richer households may be less likely to participate because of the high opportunity cost of their time or because of privacy concerns. It is conceivable that the poorest can likewise be underrepresented; some are homeless or nomadic and hard to reach in standard household survey designs, and some may be physically or socially isolated and thus less likely to be interviewed. This can bias both poverty and inequality measurement if not corrected for."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"Growth rates are calculated as annualized average growth rates over a roughly five-year period. Since many countries do not conduct surveys on a precise five-year schedule, the following rules guide selection of the survey years used to calculate the growth rates in the 2015 update: the final year of the growth period (T1) is the most recent year of a survey but no earlier than 2010, and the initial year (T0) is as close to T1 � 5 as possible, within a two-year band. Thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from three to seven years. If two surveys are equidistant from T1 � 5, other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. The comparability of welfare aggregates (income or consumption) for the years chosen for T0 and T1 is assessed for every country. If comparability across the two surveys is a major concern, the selection criteria are re-applied to select the next best survey year.\r\nOnce two surveys are selected for a country, the annualized growth of mean per capita real income or consumption is computed by first estimating the mean per capita real income or consumption of the bottom 40 percent of the welfare distribution in years T0 and T1 and then computing the annual average growth rate between those years using a compound growth formula, (Mean in T_1)/(Mean in T_0 )?^(1/( T_1- T_0 ))-1.

The choice of consumption or income to measure shared prosperity for a country is consistent with the welfare aggregate used to estimate extreme poverty rates in PovcalNet, unless there are strong arguments for using a different welfare aggregate. The practice adopted by the World Bank Group for estimating global and regional poverty rates is, in principle, to use per capita consumption expenditure as the welfare measure wherever available and to use income as the welfare measure for countries for which consumption data are unavailable.

The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time. In periods of economic recession, the wage share provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour incomes relative to profits. If labour incomes fall at a greater rate than profits, the wage share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in labour incomes, the wage share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the wage share can fall as a result of falling wage employment, falling wages or a combination of both.\r\nIncreased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors. \r\nIf there is a large number of non-resident border or seasonal workers or inflows and outflows of property income such that the value of production differs from the income of residents, there may be a situation of over or understating the living standards of residents."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Compensation of employees is the total in-cash or in-kind remuneration payable to the employee by the enterprise for the work performed by the employee during the accounting period.

The below definitions and concepts are important for reporting on this indicator;\r\nProportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing is currently being measured by the Proportion of urban population living in slums."},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"As the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are turning a page, the unprecedented proliferation of slums and informal settlements, and a chronic lack of adequate housing, continue to be amongst the major challenges of urbanization. Slums, informal settlements and inadequate housing are the face of poverty and inequality in cities, and no transformative action will be achieved in the world without addressing the challenge of urban poverty represented by them. Therefore, it is necessary to further ensure access for all to adequate housing and basic services and upgrade slums, for the full recognition of the urban poor as rightful urban dwellers, for realizing their potential and for enhancing their prosperity, and thus the prosperity of the whole urban environ.\r\nThis indicator is extremely relevant since it is partly a continuation of the MDGs (Target 7.D). As per all the agreed goals and targets, to measure the achievement of this indicator will require the mobilisation of the means required to efficiently monitor them, calling up for a revitalised partnership with the participation of all countries, all stakeholders and all communities concerned.\r\nToday, in our world, one in eight people live in slums (UN-Habitat, 2016; UN-Habitat, 2015b). This means that a quarter of the world�s urban population are slum dwellers. In several cities, poor families struggle to access adequate housing. Living in central locations often equals to inadequate living conditions, while living in peripheries, where housing can be more affordable, entails deprivation of basic services, urban amenities and access to livelihoods.\r\nSlum upgrading and adequate housing have an equalizing impact in the distribution of prosperity, thus helping urban environs to be inclusive and end urban poverty in the world.\r\nIn order to address the wording proposed by Target 11.1 and Indicator 11.1, and to provide a statistical continuity between MDGs and SDGs in what refers to the people living in slums, the five components of the �slum household� definition (access to water, access to sanitation, structural durability, overcrowding and security of tenure) must form the basis to monitor SDG 11 Target 11.1, complemented by the extra indicators that will allow measurements referring to informal settlements and inadequate housing, respectively.\r\nOne extra indicator for inadequate housing and one for informal settlements � totaling seven variables to be measured � could keep the tracking of this target manageable. In the case of informal settlements, the existence of a municipal permit is a workable means of measurement, while inadequate housing could be effectively measured through affordability criteria, as at least 330 million households around the world are financially stretched by housing costs (McKinsey Global Institute, 2014)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"a. Slums � In the wake of the MDGs� launching, an Expert Group Meeting was convened in 2002 by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Statistics Division and the Cities Alliance to agree on an operational definition for slums to be used for measuring the indicator of MDG 7 Target 7.D, �to have achieved by 2020 a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers�. The agreed definition classified a �slum household� as one in which the inhabitants suffer one or more of the following �household deprivations�: 1) Lack of access to improved water source, 2) Lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, 3) Lack of sufficient living area, 4) Lack of housing durability and, 5) Lack of security of tenure. By extension, the term �slum dweller� refers to a person living in a household that lacks any of the above attributes (UN-Habitat, 2003a).\r\nThese five components � all derived from the �adequate housing� definition (see below) � have been used, ever since for reporting and tracking of the MDGs, as the primary or secondary data measured to determine the number of slum dwellers living in developing countries, and they were also the basis to establish the successful achievement of MDG Target 7.D. For each component, the experts agreed with the following definitions (UN-Habitat, 2003b; United Nations, 2007):\r\nAccess to improved water � A household is considered to have access to improved drinking water if it has sufficient amount of water (20 litres/person/day) for family use, at an affordable price (less than 10% of the total household income) and available to household members without being subject to extreme effort (less than one hour a day for the minimum sufficient quantity), especially to women and children. An improved drinking water source is a facility that is protected from outside contamination, in particular from faecal matters� contamination. Improved drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, plot or yard; public tap/stand pipe serving no more than 5 households; protected spring; rainwater collection; bottled water (if secondary source is also improved); bore hole/tube well; and, protected dug well.\r\nAccess to improved sanitation � A household is considered to have access to improved sanitation if an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a reasonable number of people, is available to household members. Such improved sanitation facilities, therefore, hygienically separates human waste from human contact. Improved facilities include: flush/pour-flush toilets or latrines connected to a sewer, septic tank or pit; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab or platform which covers the pit entirely; and, composting toilets/latrines.\r\nSufficient living area � A dwelling unit provides sufficient living area for the household members if not more than three people share the same habitable room. Additional indicators of overcrowding have been proposed: area-level indicators such as average in-house living area per person or the number of households per area. Additionally, housing-unit level indicators such as the number of persons per bed or the number of children under five per room may also be viable. However, the number of persons per room has been shown to correlate with adverse health risks and is more commonly collected through household surveys (UN-Habitat, 1998).\r\nStructural quality/durability of dwellings � A house is considered as �durable� if it is built on a non-hazardous location and has a permanent and adequate structure able to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions such as rain, heat, cold, and humidity. The following criteria are used to determine the structural quality/durability of dwellings: permanency of structure (permanent building material for the walls, roof and floor; compliance with building codes; the dwelling is not in a dilapidated state; the dwelling is not in need of major repair); and location of house (hazardous location; the dwelling is not located on or near toxic waste; the dwelling is not located in a flood plain; the dwelling is not located on a steep slope; the dwelling is not located in a dangerous right of way � rail , highway, airport, power lines).\r\nSecurity of tenure � Secure tenure is the right of all individuals and groups to effective protection by the State against forced evictions. Security of tenure is understood as a set of relationships with respect to housing and land, established through statutory or customary law or informal or hybrid arrangements, that enables one to live in one�s home with security, peace and dignity (A/HRC/25/54). Regardless of the type of tenure, all persons with security of tenure have a legal status against arbitrary unlawful eviction, harassment and other threats. People have secure tenure when: there is evidence of documentation that can be used as proof of secure tenure status; and, there is either de facto or perceived protection from forced evictions. Important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into the computation of the people living in slums.\r\nb. Informal Settlements � Informal settlements are not only found in the developing world, but they thrive in the developed world, too. Similarly, informal housing units are not poverty�s peculiarity, but they belong to all income levels. Therefore, informal settlements can be defined (United Nations, 2015; UN-Habitat, 2015b) as residential areas where: 1) inhabitants have no security of tenure vis-�-vis the land or dwellings they inhabit, with modalities ranging from squatting to informal rental housing, 2) the neighbourhoods usually lack, or are cut off from, basic services and formal city infrastructure and 3) the housing may not comply with current planning and building regulations, is often situated in geographically and environmentally hazardous areas, and may lack a municipal permit. Informal settlements can be a form of real estate speculation for all income levels of urban residents, affluent and poor. Slums are the poorest and most dilapidated form of informal settlements.\r\nInformality should be understood as a technicality more than an income-based denomination that stigmatises the poor, therefore informal settlements� estimates should be based on a technical compliance relevant to all income levels. For example, an approved municipal permit for any given housing unit would be a clear indication of formality. If municipalities lack the capacity to deliver such a permit, this is an administrative gap that this indicator will also point out. Most likely, municipalities will be eager to collect the necessary data, as municipal permits entail municipal revenue.\r\nc. Inadequate Housing � Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights includes �adequate housing� as one of the components of the right to adequate standards of living for all. Adequate housing must provide more than four walls and a roof. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights� general comments No.4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing and No.7 (1997) on forced evictions have underlined that the right to adequate housing should be seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity. For housing to be adequate, it must, at a minimum, meet the following criteria: 1) Legal security of tenure, which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment and other threats; 2) Availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, including safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, energy for cooking, heating, lighting, food storage or refuse disposal; 3) Affordability, as housing is not adequate if its cost threatens or compromises the occupants� enjoyment of other human rights; 4) Habitability, as housing is not adequate if it does not guarantee physical safety or provide adequate space, as well as protection against the cold, damp, heat, rain, wind, other threats to health and structural hazards; 5) Accessibility, as housing is not adequate if the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups are not taken into account (such as the poor, people facing discrimination; persons with disabilities, victims of natural disasters); 6) Location, as housing is not adequate if it is cut off from employment opportunities, health-care services, schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, or if located in dangerous or polluted sites or in immediate proximity to pollution sources; 7) Cultural adequacy, as housing is not adequate if it does not respect and take into account the expression of cultural identity and ways of life.\r\nThe measurement of �inadequate housing� is meant to complement that of slums, and informal settlements particularly in the developed world where the �slum household� definition is less applicable, ensuring the universality of Indicator 11.1. Even though countries with available data could measure the full spectrum of the adequate housing components, for the purpose of measurability it is recommended that only one of the elements of the adequate housing definition is selected for measurement. Affordability is not only a key housing adequacy criterion, but it is the most suitable means of measurement for inadequate housing, as affordability increasingly becomes a global crisis with strong negative impact on the wellbeing of people and on the exacerbation of urban inequality. The underlying principle is that households financial costs associated with housing should not threaten or compromise the attainment and satisfaction of other basic needs such as, food, education, access to health care, transport, etc. Based on the existing method and data through the Urban Indicators Program (1996-2006), affordability is measured as the net monthly expenditure on housing cost that exceeds 30% of the total monthly income of the household."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Different local characteristics of poor housing units around the world and the under recognition of the slum challenge by some concerned authorities and stakeholders have made it difficult to agree universally on some definitions and characteristics when referring to poor informal housing.\r\nThe lack of appropriate tools at national and city levels to measure all the components required to monitor indicator 11.1 has often brought challenges for statistics offices to reliably include all components that measure slums, sometimes resulting in the underestimation of poor housing units or slum households. We have scheduled several technical workshops and EGMs that will help build the capacity for reporting in the first 3 years of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nIn the case of security of tenure, its complicated relation with land and property makes it a difficult aspect to include in the different related surveys and, therefore, to measure and monitor due to lack of routine data. However, the most recent years, important progress has been made to integrate the measurement of this component into major surveys and censuses in several countries.\r\nAlso, Indicator 11.1 does not capture homelessness, as it is not included in household surveys.\r\nFinally, many countries still have limited capacities for data management, data collection and monitoring, and continue to grapple with limited data on large or densely populated geographical areas. This means that complementarity in data reporting will be key to ensure that both national and global figures achieve consistencies in the final reported data."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"Method of computation � This indicator considers three components to be computed as follows:\r\na) Slum households (SH): = 100[(Number of people living in slum)/(City population)]\r\nb) Informal settlements households (ISH): = 100[(No.of people living in informal settlements households)/(City population)]\r\nc) Inadequate housing households (IHH): = 100[(No. of people living in inadequate housing)/(City population)]\r\nThe unit of measurements for all these indicators will be %.

So far, UN-Habitat collects information related to slums and improved shelter as part of the City Prosperity Initiative (CPI) including several other related indicators, such as: i) improved shelter; ii) access to improved water; iii) access to improved sanitation; and iv) overcrowding. Data is being collected for nearly 1000 cities around the world. The method of data collection and the use of this information are critical for the understanding of indicator 11.1.

Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times\r\nc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment"},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"This indicator aims to successfully monitor the use of and access to the public transportation system and the move towards easing the reliance on the private means of transportation, improving the access to areas with a high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, physically challenged individuals, and low income earners or areas with specific dwelling types such as high occupancy buildings or public housing and reducing the need for mobility by decreasing the number of trips and the distances travelled. The accessibility based urban mobility paradigm also critically needs good, high-capacity public transport systems that are well integrated in a multimodal arrangement with public transport access points located within comfortable walking or cycling distances from homes and jobs for all. \r\nThe ability of residents including persons with disabilities and businesses to access markets, employment opportunities, and service centers such as schools and hospitals is critical to urban economic development. The transport system provides access to resources and employment opportunity. Moreover, accessibility allows planners to measure the effects of changes in transport and land use systems. The accessibility of jobs, services and markets also allow policymakers, citizens and businesses to discuss the state of the transport system in the comprehensible way. The transportation system is a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion. The access to transport SDG indicator addresses a significant gap that was never addressed by the MDGs, i.e. directly addressing transport as a critical enabler of economic activities and social inclusion. Already, the \"externalities\" associated with transport in terms of Green House Gas Emissions, traffic congestion and road traffic accidents have been increasing. Emissions from transport are now responsible for 23% of global Green House Gas Emissions and are increasing faster than any other source; outdoor air pollution alone, a major source of which is transport, is responsible for 3.7 million deaths annually, road traffic accidents kill more than 1.2 million people every year and severe traffic congestion is choking cities and impacting on GDPs. Achieving SDG 11 requires a fundamental shift in the thinking on transport- with the focus on the goal of transport rather than on its means. With accessibility to services, goods and opportunities for all as the ultimate goal, priority is given to making cities more compact and walkable through better planning and the integration of land-use planning with transport planning. The means of transport are also important but the SDG�s imperative to make the city more inclusive means that cities will have to move away from car-based travel to public transport and active modes of transport such as walking and cycling with good inter-modal connectivity. \r\nThe rising traffic congestion levels and the resulting negative air quality in many metropolitan areas have elevated the need for a successful public transportation system to ease the reliance on the private means of transportation. Cities that choose to invest in effective public transportation options stand out to gain in the long-run. Cities that have convenient access to public transport, including access by persons with disabilities are more preferred as these are more likely to offer lower transportation costs while improving on the environment, congestion and travel times within the city. At the same time, improving the access to areas with a high proportion of transport disadvantaged groups such as elderly citizens, physically challenged individuals, and low income earners or areas with specific dwelling types such as high occupancy buildings or public housing also helps increase the efficiency and the sustainability of the public transport system. Public transport is a very important equalizer of income, consumption and spatial inequalities. This indicator is empirically proven that public transport make cities more inclusive, safe and sustainable. Effective and low-cost transportation is critical for reducing urban poverty and inequalities and enhancing economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services and other public goods. \r\nClean public transport is a very efficient mean for the reduction of CO2 emissions and therefore it contributes to climate change and lower levels of energy consumption. Most importantly public transport need to be easily accessible to the elderly and disabled citizens."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. Because most public transport users walk from their trip origins to public transport stops and from public transport stops to their trip destination, local spatial availability and accessibility is sometimes evaluated in terms of pedestrian (walk) access, as opposed to park and ride or transfers.\r\nHence, the access to public transport is considered convenient when an officially recognized stop is accessible within a distance of 0.5 km from a reference point such as a home, school, work place, market, etc. Additional criteria for defining public transport that is convenient include:\r\na. Public transport accessible to all special-needs customers, including those who are physically, visually, and/or hearing-impaired, as well as those with temporary disabilities, the elderly, children and other people in vulnerable situations.\r\nb. Public transport with frequent service during peak travel times\r\nc. Stops present a safe and comfortable station environment\r\nPublic transport is defined as a shared passenger transport service that is available to the general public. It includes cars, buses, trolleys, trams, trains, subways, and ferries that are shared by strangers without prior arrangement. However, it excludes taxis, car pools, and hired buses, which are not shared by strangers without prior arrangement. It also excludes informal, unregulated modes of transport (para-transit), motorcycle taxis, three-wheelers, etc.\r\nPublic transport refers to a public service that is considered as a public good that has well designed �stops� for passengers to embark and disembark in a safe manner and demarcated �routes� that are both officially and/or formally recognized.\r\nAdditional methodological comments:\r\nThe method to estimate the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport is based on four steps: \r\na) Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration: \r\nDelimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometres). Area of delimitation should be aligned with census enumeration areas to match with demographic data.\r\nb) Inventory of the public transport stops in the city or the service area: \r\nInformation can be obtained from city administration or service providers. In some cases where this information is lacking, incomplete or outdated, open sources and community-based maps, which are increasingly recognized as a valid source of information, can be a viable alternative.\r\nWhen information is available, characteristics of the quality, universal accessibility for people with disabilities, safety, and frequency of the service can be �assigned� to the public transport stops� inventory for detailed analysis and further disaggregation according to the statistical capacities of countries and cities. \r\nc) Estimation of urban area with access to public transport:\r\nTo calculate the indicator it is necessary to use a map with the inventory of officially-recognized public transport stops and create a buffer area of 500m radius for each stop. Merge and clip with boundary of the boundary built-up area of the urban agglomeration.\r\nd) Estimation of the proportion of the population with convenient access out of the total population of the city:\r\nOverlay GIS demographic data on the number of dwellings within the area with access to public transport stop. Calculate the population within those dwellings. Estimate the proportion of population out of the total population of the city.\r\nComplementary to the above, other parameters of tracking the transport target include the following:\r\na) Accessibility related to urban planning: this parameter can be measured using density (people/sq.km) from census surveys, Percentage of street space in cities and Number of Intersections / Sq.Km from analysis of earth observations and/or city maps. Density is an important determinant for the efficiency of public transport systems. The adequacy of streets and crossings determine urban accessibility to a great extent. \r\nb) Accessibility related to transport planning: this parameter can be measured using Percentage of population within 500m of mass transit stop from City maps and sample survey data.\r\nc) Affordability: this can be obtained from Percentage of household income of lowest quintile of population spent on transport from Sample surveys and WTP surveys. Poorest quintile should not spend more than 5% (TBD) on transport.\r\nd) Quality: this parameter can be measured using travel time, universal access, safety, security, comfort and user information from sample surveys.\r\ne) Modal shift to sustainable transport: this is also expressed in Modal share (cars, NMT, PT), Passenger KM travelled on EV as percentage of total passenger KM travelled in urban areas from City mobility surveys. This parameter is also important due to transport�s contribution to carbon emissions and air quality issues in cities."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"As the Outcome Document 2nd Meeting of the Urban SDGs Campaign in Bangalore (12-14 February 2015) recognizes that  no internationally agreed methodology exists for measuring convenience and service quality of public transport. Harmonized global/local data on urban transport systems do not exist, nor are they comparable at the world level.\r\nIt is recognized that convenience measured as distance does not categorize the quality of the public transport which will vary from country to country. Nevertheless, the proposed indicator is a comparable and objective measurement that can be assessed in cities across regions.\r\nOther factors of this indicator such as affordability, safety, and universal accessibility may influence the usage of public means of mobility beyond proximity to the transport stop. Yet, the provision of widely accessible public transport is a precondition for its usage.\r\nFinally, high capacity public transport, such as trains allows for a larger capture area, beyond the 0.5km of the proposed indicator.\r\nIt is also recognized that there are various forms of public transport in the member countries that are not fully defined or captured in this methodology. In particular, many developing countries have access to public transport that is available anywhere on the streets and not necessarily at designated public transport stops. The creation of designated stops is a precondition of measurement in these countries."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"Method of Computation\r\nThis indicator is computed based on the following criteria:\r\nThe identification of service areas is typically achieved using the buffering operation (using GIS) by constructing lines of equal proximity around each public transport stop or each public transport route. The buffering operation clearly involves at least two decisions. The first decision is whether routes or stops should be used as the reference of measurement. The two approaches may lead to very different values of spatial availability. But generally, public transport stops offer a more appropriate basis than routes for estimating service area coverage because stops are the actual locations where public transport users access the system. The other decision involved in the buffering operation is the buffer size. A common practice in public transport planning is to assume that people are served by public transport if they are within 0.5km (or 500m) of either a public transport route or stop. Once a distance threshold is defined, buffers are created around the public transport features. Some studies measure the distance based on air, or Euclidean, distance, while others use network distance (that is, the walk distance computed using the street network to reach a public transport feature. Since the network distance between two locations in space is greater than, or equal to, the corresponding air distance, the size of a coverage area defined by the network distance will be smaller than, or equal to, that defined by air distance. Network distance measures are likely to be more realistic because they reflect the configuration of the street network and recognize the presence of any man-made barriers preventing direct access to public transport features. In addition to using the above mentioned distance measures, others have suggested the use of travel time to public transport features as a measure of proximity. Using travel time is preferable to distance as a measure of proximity because travel time measures account for such pedestrian-unfriendly factors such as steep terrains. However, because of the additional data requirements and the amount of processing effort involved, travel time measures are rarely used in practice. For this indicator  the public transport stop will be used as the point of service.\r\nThe identification of the population served\r\nOnce a service buffer is constructed, the next step is to overlay the buffer onto other polygons, such as census tracts, for which socio-demographic data (such as population figures, disabled persons, type of residence area, etc. is available. These polygons are referred to as the analysis zones. Typically, a service buffer (denoted as i) intersects, either fully or partially, with more than one analysis zone j ( j=1�..J). The population served by the public transport service in buffer i, Pi, is thus equal to the sum of the population in each of the intersecting areas, Pij . Hence\r\nPi=?_(j=1)^J�Pij\r\nWhere, Pij is estimated based on the amount of interaction between service buffer i and analysis zone j.\r\nIn estimating Pij it is assumed that the population is uniformly distributed within the analysis zones.\r\nIntegrating local temporal availability.\r\nThe methodology described above covers public transport service solely based on spatial access to stops or routes and does not address the temporal dimension associated with the availability of public transport. We note that temporal aspect of public transport availability is important because a service within walking distance is not necessarily considered as available if waiting times go beyond a certain threshold level that is required. This wait time for public transport is related to the frequency of the service as well as the threshold for tolerable waits for potential public transport users. We will leave out completely the temporal measurement for global comparison, but countries that can additionally capture this component are encouraged to collect and report this information as part of the disaggregation.\r\nFinally, the population with access to public transport out of the entire city population will be computed as;\r\n Percentage with access to Public transport =100x (population with convenient access to Public transport)/(City Population)"},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Information can be disaggregated as shown below, including potential disadvantages such as disability, but it requires strong efforts and changes in mainstream mechanisms of data collection: \r\nDisaggregation by location (intra-urban). \r\nDisaggregation by income group. \r\nDisaggregation by sex (female-headed household). \r\nDisaggregation by race (head of household). \r\nDisaggregation by ethnicity (head of household). \r\nDisaggregation by migratory status (head of household). \r\nDisaggregation by age (households inhabitant). \r\nDisaggregation by mode of public transport.\r\nQuantifiable Derivatives: \r\n- Proportion of urban area that has convenient access to public transport. \r\n- Proportion of population/urban area that has convenient access to public transport stop with universal accessibility for people with disabilities. \r\n- Proportion of population/urban area that has frequent access to public transport during peak hours. \r\n- Proportion of population/urban area that has frequent access to public transport during off-peak hours. \r\n- Proportion of urban central/suburban area that has convenient access to public transport."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"Missing data is anticipated in the first few years of collection of data for this indicator, and this will be largely as a result of the slow adoption of the proposed methodology by the national governments and statistical systems.

Computing the population growth rate is more straightforward and more readily available, while land consumption rate is slightly challenging, and requires the use of new techniques. In estimating the land consumption rate, one needs to define what constitutes \"consumption\" of land since this may cover aspects of \"consumed\" or \"preserved\" or available for \"development\" for cases such as land occupied by wetlands. Secondly, there is not one unequivocal measure of whether land that is being developed is truly \"newly-developed\" (or vacant) land, or if it is at least partially \"redeveloped\". As a result, the percentage of current total urban land that was newly developed (consumed) will be used as a measure of the land consumption rate. The fully developed area is also sometimes referred to as built up area."},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"Globally, land cover today is altered principally by direct human use: by agriculture and livestock raising, forest harvesting and management and urban and suburban construction and development. A defining feature of many of the world�s cities is an outward expansion far beyond formal administrative boundaries, largely propelled by the use of the automobile, poor urban and regional planning and land speculation. A large proportion of cities both from developed and developing countries have high consuming suburban expansion patterns, which often extend to even further peripheries. A global study on 120 cities shows that urban land cover has, on average, grown more than three times as much as the urban population [1]; in some cases similar studies at national level showed a difference that was three to five times fold. [3]. In order to effectively monitor land consumption growth, it is not only necessary to have the information on existing land use cover but also the capability to monitor the dynamics of land use resulting out of both changing demands of increasing population and forces of nature acting to shape the landscape.\r\nCities require an orderly urban expansion that makes the land use more efficient. They need to plan for future internal population growth and city growth resulting from migrations. They also need to accommodate new and thriving urban functions such as transportation routes, etc., as they expand. However, frequently the physical growth of urban areas is disproportionate in relation to population growth, and these results in land use that is less efficient in many forms. This type of growth turns out to violate every premise of sustainability that an urban area could be judged by including impacting on the environment and causing other negative social and economic consequences such as increasing spatial inequalities and lessening of economies of agglomeration.\r\nThis indicator is connected to many other indicators of the SDGs. It ensures that the SDGs integrate the wider dimensions of space, population and land adequately, providing the framework for the implementation of other goals such as poverty, health, education, energy, inequalities and climate change. The indicator has a multipurpose measurement as it is not only related to the type/form of the urbanization pattern. It is also used to capture various dimensions of land use efficiency: economic (proximity of factors of production); environmental (lower per capita rates of resource use and GHG emissions); social (reduced travel distance and cost expended). Finally, this indicator integrates an important spatial component and is fully in line with the recommendations made by the Data Revolution initiative."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Population growth rate (PGR) is the increase of a population in a country during a period, usually one year, expressed as a percentage of the population at the start of that period. It reflects the number of births and deaths during a period and the number of people migrating to and from a country.\r\nLand consumption includes: (a) The expansion of built-up area which can be directly measured; (b) the absolute extent of land that is subject to exploitation by agriculture, forestry or other economic activities; and (c) the over-intensive exploitation of land that is used for agriculture and forestry."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"In some cases, it is difficult to measure the urban expansion by conurbations of two or more urban areas that are in close proximity; to whom to attribute the urban growth and how to include it as one metric usually becomes a challenge. At the same time, data would not always coincide to administrative levels, boundaries and built-up areas. However, the European Commission highlights some possible drawbacks of this indicator that can be technically addressed. Efforts to use the area of reference at the level of the built-up area of the urban agglomeration should be taken into consideration. The delimitation of city boundaries may be another methodological problem that a clear agreed definition can solve.\r\nThe indicator may experience difficulties in capturing cities with negative or zero population growth; or cities that due to severe disaster have lost part of their territories. To face this challenge, the baseline/benchmark of population density and its change over time must be taken into consideration. Reducing densities below sustainable levels have impacts on the cities� sustainability.\r\nIn the absence of the GIS layers, this indicator may not be computed as defined. As a result more alternative measures for land that is developed or consumed per year can be adequately used. Alternatively, one can monitor the efficient use of urban land by measuring how well we are achieving the densities in residential zones that any city plans or international guidance call for. Comparing achieved to planned densities is very useful at the city level. However, planned densities vary greatly from country to country, and at times from city to city. At the sub-regional or city levels, it is more appropriate to compare average densities achieved currently to those achieved in the recent past. While building more densely does use land more efficiently, high density neighborhoods, especially in and around urban centers, have a number of other advantages. They support more frequent public transportation, and more local stores and shops; they encourage pedestrian activity to and from local establishments; and they create lively (and sometimes safer) street life."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"The formula to estimate the land use efficiency will be provided with two stages.\r\nStage 1: Estimate the population growth rate. \r\nPopulation Growth rate i.e. PGR=LN(Popt_(t+n)/?Popt_t )/((y))\r\nWhere \r\nPopt Total population within the city in the past/initial year\r\nPopt+n Total population within the city in the current/final year\r\ny The number of years between the two measurement periods\r\nStage 2: Estimating the land consumption rate\r\nThis rate gives us a measure of compactness which indicates a progressive spatial expansion of a city. \r\nLand consumption rate i.e LCR=LN(Urb_(t+n)/Urb_t )/((y))\r\nWhere\r\nUrb_t Total areal extent of the urban agglomeration in km2 for past/initial year \r\nUrb_(t+n) Total areal extent of the urban agglomeration in km2 for current year \r\ny The number of years between the two measurement periods\r\nThe formula to estimate the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR) is provided as follows:\r\nLCRPGR= (+ ( Land Consumption rate)/(Annual Population growth rate)�)\r\nAnd the overall formula can be summarized as:\r\nLCRPGR=(((LN(Urb_(t+n)/Urb_t ))/y))/((LN(Pop_(t+n)/Pop_t )/y) ) \r\nThe periods for both- urban expansion and population growth rates should be at comparable scale."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Potential Disaggregation:\r\n- Disaggregation by location (intra-urban)\r\n- Disaggregation by income level\r\n- Disaggregation by urban typology\r\nQuantifiable Derivatives\r\n- Population density\r\n- Population density growth/reduction rate\r\n- Annual amount of urban expansion (km2)\r\nPercentage of urban expansion in relation to the urban footprint area"},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"All countries are expected to fully report on this indicator more consistently after 2-3 years with few challenges where missing values will be reported due to missing base map files.

"},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"The target addressed, Target 11.6, is reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management by 2030.\r\nWaste collection is the collection and transportation of waste to the place of treatment or discharge by municipal services or similar institutions, or by public or private corporations, specialized enterprises or general government (United Nations, 1997).\r\nA prosperous city seeks to collect and manage appropriately all its solid waste and improve standards of living, cleanliness and hence decrease the chances of having disease outbreaks related to the improper management of waste.\r\nUrban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste, including industrial, construction and hazardous waste that must be collected regularly and disposed-off properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living conditions. Such waste collection is available through formal or informal means. Uncollected and improperly managed solid waste can end up in drains and dumps leading to blocked drainages and cause unsanitary conditions. Vectors such as mosquitos usually breed in blocked drainages and dumps that are not well managed. In summary, waste collection management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on health, the environment or aesthetics, and the entire ecosystems that support the city or urban area. Sustainable solid waste management is essential for the sustainability of cities especially if it includes waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, incineration, and disposal in landfills. Within a waste management hierarchy, waste prevention and reuse are the most preferred methods and should be promoted, as they reduce the demand on scarce environmental resources, reduce energy use, and minimize the quantity of waste that must eventually be recycled, incinerated or disposed in landfills.\r\nRegardless of the context, managing solid waste is one of the important challenges of urban areas of all sizes. According to UN-Habitat�s Solid Waste Management in the World�s Cities, when the current modernization process started in developed countries during the 1970s, solid waste management was seen largely as a technical problem with engineering solutions. That changed during the 1980s and 1990s when it became clear that municipalities could not successfully collect and remove waste without active cooperation from the service users. Cities also learned that technologies depend on institutional, governance and policy frameworks, which are highly varied and complex, and directly related to local conditions. The way in which waste is produced and discarded gives us a key insight into how people live, and the quality of waste management services is a good indicator of a city�s governance. \r\nTarget 11.6 also has linkages to the health, poverty, and water goals. For instance there are significant linkages to water targets, including sanitation and hygiene (6.2), water quality and wastewater management (6.3), water-related ecosystems (6.5) and integrated water resources management (6.5). Such links may be relevant to planning and implementation at the country level and it will be important to harness synergies and manage potential conflicts or trade-offs both within and between the targets. This will require collaboration across institutions that are traditionally structured in silos that focus on specific sectors. New ways of collaborative working in partnerships with either informal or formal mechanisms are needed to facilitate collaboration such that policy makers, managers and experts with different responsibilities are able to harness the synergies between goals and targets. This will be a major challenge in implementation of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nHaving in place an appropriate monitoring framework that is founded on the key components of the ISWM framework for the SDG 11 target 6.1, enhanced coordination amongst the relevant national and local institutions in the process of implementation, and a full engagement of particularly the national statistical entities and responsible governmental agencies in the process, will go a long way to assist national governments to be able to rationalise their efforts to collect, analyse, validate data and information and report on a regular basis within a context that facilitates comparisons among countries. \r\nAn integrated solid waste management system is strongly connected to three dimensions: urban environmental health, the environment and resource management. Moreover, a regular solid waste management strategy is clear indicator of the effectiveness of a municipal administration [2]. Good waste governance that is inclusive, financially sustainable and based on sound institutions is one of the key challenges of the 21st century, and one of the key responsibilities of a city government.\r\nMoving towards modern disposal has generally followed a step-by-step process: first phasing out uncontrolled disposal, then introducing, and gradually increasing, environmental standards for a disposal facility. In the process, controlling water pollution and methane emissions from sanitary landfills, and air pollution from incinerators, receive increasing attention.\r\nMany developing and transitional country cities still have an active informal sector and micro-enterprise recycling, reuse and repair; often achieve recycling and recovery rates comparable to those in the west, resulting in savings to the waste management budget of the cities. There is a major opportunity for the city to build on these existing recycling systems, reducing some unsustainable practices and enhancing them to protect and develop people�s livelihoods, and to reduce still further the costs to the city of managing the residual wastes. The formal and informal sectors need to work together, for the benefit of both."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"It will be necessary to define the following components to compute the proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected that is adequately discharge out of all the total urban waste generated by the city.\r\nUrban Solid waste or municipal solid waste is generally composed of waste from households, offices, shops, schools and industries. These include food waste, garden (yard) and park waste, paper and cardboard, wood, textiles, nappies (disposable diapers), rubber and leather, plastics, metal, glass (and pottery and china), health-care waste, electronic waste (such as discarded computers, printers, mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators) and refuse such as ash, dirt, dust, soil construction and demolition waste. It excludes waste water [1]. The aggregate tonnes of all the solid waste from all the sources mentioned above give us the total solid waste generated by the city.\r\nMunicipal Solid Waste is waste generated by households, and waste of a similar nature generated by commercial and business establishments, industrial and agricultural premises, institutions such as schools and hospitals, public spaces such as parks and streets and construction sites. Generally it is non-hazardous wastes composed of food waste, garden waste, paper and cardboard, wood, textiles, nappies (disposable diapers), rubber and leather, plastics, metal, glass, and refuse such as ash, dirt and dust. Sewage sludge and faecal sludge is also included in the category of municipal solid waste but it excludes wastewater. \r\nOther Solid Waste is waste that require special treatment such as hazardous waste from industrial processes, agricultural activities and mining wastes, hospital waste, end of life vehicles, construction and demolition waste and WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment). Cities in developed countries in general have special treatment and disposal system that are designed to collect and handle these separately from municipal solid waste, while it is not uncommon that these are mixed and dumped in an uncontrolled manner in cities in developing countries. \r\nRegularly Collected Waste refers to waste that is routinely collected from specific addresses or designated collection points. Waste collection is conducted directly by municipal authorities or private contractors licensed/commissioned by municipal authorities with a regular schedule of the day of the week and time of collection. In some cases private waste collection companies have contracts with clients individually and provide collection services. \r\nUncollected Waste refers to waste generated in a city but uncollected due to the lack of collection services. In many cities informal settlements areas do not have access to this basic services. The amount of uncollected waste can be estimated by waste generation per capita in the city multiplied by the population who does not have access to the solid waste collection service.\r\nTotal Waste Generated by the City is sum of municipal solid waste and other solid waste, or the sum of regularly collected waste and uncollected waste. This excludes some portion that was taken and recycled before the solid waste collection.\r\nAdequate Final Discharge refers to waste that is recycled in regulated recycling facilities, composted or incinerated in regulated composting and incineration facilities and disposed in sanitary landfills in environmentally adequate ways. It excludes waste handled in recycling, composting, incineration facilities that do not have necessary pollution control systems and labour safety standards required by international guidelines or national and local legislations such as waste water treatment and air pollution prevention systems and provision of necessary equipment for workers. It also excludes solid waste that is incinerated and burned openly or disposed to open dumb without leachate facility. \r\nRecycling is defined as the process by which materials otherwise destined for disposal are collected, processed, and remanufactured or reused except reuse as fuel. Direct recycling within industrial plants at the place of generation should be excluded. \r\nComposting is defined as a biological process that involves aerobic biological decomposition of organic materials to produce stable humus-like product. Biodegradation is a natural, ongoing biological process that is a common occurrence in both human-made and natural environments. \r\nIncinerating is thermal treatment of waste during which chemically fixed energy of combusted matters is transformed into thermal energy. Combustible compounds are transformed into combustion gases leaving the system as flue gases. Incombustible inorganic matters remain in the form of slag and fly ash. Incinerating includes incinerating with or without energy recovery.\r\nLandfilling is the environmentally sound disposal of waste that cannot be reduced, recycled, composted, incinerated or processed in some other manner. A landfill is needed for disposing of residues from recycling, composting, incinerating or other processing facilities and can be used if the alternative facilities break down.\r\nThe concept of integrated and sustainable (solid) waste management, known as Integrated solid waste management (ISWM), is designed to improve the performance of solid waste system and to support sound decision-making. It comprises three key physical elements that all need to be addressed for an ISWM system to work well and to work sustainably over the long term. These are:\r\n1. Public health: maintaining healthy conditions in cities, particularly through a good waste collection service;\r\n2. Environment: protection of the environment throughout the waste chain, especially during treatment and disposal; and\r\n3. Resource management: �closing the loop� by returning both materials and nutrients to beneficial use, through preventing waste and striving for high rates of organics recovery, reuse and recycling\r\nThese three key physical elements require appropriately designed governance strategies to deliver a well-functioning system. Three interrelated requirements for a \"good waste governance\" system are to:\r\n1. Be inclusive, providing transparent spaces for stakeholders to contribute as users, providers and enablers;\r\n2. Be financially sustainable, which means cost-effective and affordable; and\r\n3. Rest on a base of sound institutions and pro-active policies."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"In many countries and sub-national governments, solid waste collection and management data are currently incomplete or not available. Countries have varying policies that define appropriate waste management, with different levels of treatment and data collection. Cities and countries that have more advanced systems should report other aspects of waste management such as recycling that can be disaggregated by different components. \r\nSince this indicator has two points of reporting, i.e., the source for establishing if waste is collected regularly or not regularly, and the final discharge point and its level of adequacy, there is a need to integrate them in the monitoring. Some countries/cities have the data and monitoring systems needed to report and others may require training and capacity development to enhance their capacities. \r\nFeasibility\r\nCollection of indicators and data cannot be said infeasible but it might require training and capacity development. The data for the indicator such as total solid waste generation is globally available although the precision of data is disputable. This means that many countries have some data collection system but there are rooms for improvement. Also the collection of the data such as amount of waste adequately discharged will be a challenge for many of national and local governments. Introducing this data collection system globally is not only feasible since they usually have basic data collection system but will also contribute to enhance the solid waste monitoring capacity both at the national and local level. \r\nSuitability\r\nMany cities generate more solid waste than they can dispose of. Even when municipal budgets are adequate for collection, the safe disposal of collected wastes often remains a problem. Dumping and uncollected landfills are sometimes the main disposal methods in many developing countries; sanitary landfills are the norm in only a handful of cities [2]. While, regular solid waste collection is a clear indicator of the effectiveness of a municipal administration, appropriate waste management is an excellent mechanism to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities and in this sense, the indicator is very suitable.\r\nThis indicator is used in many countries and can also be tracked and monitored in many local governments or cities globally. Solid waste management is essential for the sustainability of cities especially if it includes: waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, incineration, and disposal in landfills. Within a waste management hierarchy, waste prevention and reuse are the most preferred methods and should be promoted, as they reduce the demand on scarce environmental resources, reduce energy use, and minimize the quantity of waste that must eventually be recycled, incinerated or disposed in landfills.\r\nRelevance\r\nWaste collection is the collection and transportation of waste to the place of treatment or discharge by municipal services or similar institutions, or by public or private corporations, specialized enterprises or general government (United Nations, 1997). A prosperous city seeks to collect and manage appropriately all its solid waste and improve standards of living, cleanliness and hence decrease the chances of having disease outbreaks related to the improper management of waste. \r\nUrban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste, including industrial, construction and hazardous waste that must be collected regularly and disposed-off properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living conditions. Such waste collection is available through formal or informal means. Uncollected and improperly managed solid waste can end up in drains and dumps leading to blocked drainages and cause unsanitary conditions. Vectors such as mosquitos usually breed in blocked drainages and dumps that are not well managed. In summary, waste collection management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on health, the environment or aesthetics, and the entire ecosystems that support the city or urban area.\r\nLimitations\r\nCountries have varying policies that define appropriate waste management, with different levels of treatment and data collection. To ensure comparability the indicator should limit to the methodology and definitions presented above. However some countries/cities have the data and monitoring systems able to report the indicator here but others may require training and capacity development to enhance their capacities."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"In order to generate the proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and that is adequately discharged out of all the total urban waste generated by the city, there is a need to define the two components that are core to this indicator i.e. what constitutes urban waste and appropriate final discharge.\r\nA two stage process is proposed for computing this indicator. First, cities will have to monitor the total waste generated by the city. Out of this tonnage, they will have to compute the proportion of the waste that was regularly collected from the various sources that generate city waste.\r\nSolid waste regularly collected = Summation in tonnes of all regularly collected waste for all sources\r\nTotal solid waste generated  = Sum of all waste generated by the city or urban area including collected and uncollected solid waste\r\nAt the second stage, cities will have to estimate the proportion of all waste that was regularly collected and was adequately discharged.\r\nAdequately discharged solid waste = Regularly collected Solid waste that is reported as adequately discharged\r\nSolid waste regularly collected and with adequate final discharge\r\n=100[ ((Adequately discharged urban solid waste)/(total tonnage of waste generated by the city)) ]"},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Data for this indicator can be disaggregated at the city and town levels.

Cities that improve and sustain the use of public space, including streets, enhance community cohesion, civic identity, and quality of life. Having access to open public spaces does not only improve the quality of life: it is also a first step toward civic empowerment and greater access to institutional and political spaces. \r\nCities function in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner only when private and public spaces work in a symbiotic relationship to enhance each other. In optimal conditions, they need to be secured and laid out in advance of urbanization to ensure orderly urban expansion. In existing cities, there is a need to revise and expand the ratio of public space in cities to make them more efficient, prosperous and sustainable. And they are needed in adequate amounts. Uncontrolled rapid urbanization creates disorderly settlement patterns with dangerously low shares of public space. Many cities in developed countries are also experiencing a dramatic reduce of public space.\r\nThe road network is the integrative tissue that binds cities together. It organizes the geographic space of cities, integrates them both as job markets and as local political spaces.\r\nCities that are walkable and transit-friendly require a highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. A tight network of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. This has clear implications in making cities more energy efficient.\r\nAdequate public spaces in cities contribute to the achievement of other targets of Goal 11 and have positive implications in various Sustainable Development Goals.

As a new and innovative indicator, data availability may be scarce. Many cities do not have an inventory of public space, or have one that is not up-to date. Efforts should be done to expand the availability of data in the developing world. UN-Habitat has developed tools, programmes and guidelines to assist cities in measuring, and expanding the availability of public space in cities. Some cities in the developing world lack of formal recognized public space that are publicly maintained. Innovative tools like the use of satellite imagery, and community-based mapping can support the identification of open space in public use.\r\nThe indicator quantifies the amount of open space in public use in cities, but does not capture the quality of the space that may impede its proper use.

The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type.\r\nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.\r\nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\r\nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011�2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:\r\n- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\r\n- Category Ib: Wilderness area\r\n- Category II: National park\r\n- Category III: Natural monument or feature\r\n- Category IV: Habitat/species management area\r\n- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\r\n- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\r\nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).\r\nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world�s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016)."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.\r\nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to \"green listing\" have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly. \r\nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\", as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011�2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et all. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" are so far still in their infancy. As these are consolidated, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" will be included into the World Database on Protected Areas and thus this indicator accordingly.\r\nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While IBAs have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). \r\nKey Biodiversity Area (KBA) identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or \"irreplaceability\") using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).\r\nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of marine KBAs through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of marine vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other methods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2015) and digital polygons for marine Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool at https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login). Any marine Key Biodiversity Areas for which >98% of their area is overlapped by one or more protected areas was defined as completely protected (to allow for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is then computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and multiplying by 100.\r\nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the WDPA, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted (Butchart et al. 2012, 2015)."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types through the marine environment (Edgar et al. 2008) and beyond. The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across marine systems along with terrestrial or freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass marine, terrestrial, and freshwater systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I�VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\r\nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for marine biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 14.5, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets include:\r\nSDG 6.6 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for freshwater biodiversity.\r\nSDG 15.1 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.\r\nSDG 15.4 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.\r\nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with eco-regional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.\r\n* At country level\r\nData are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world�s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary.\r\n* At regional and global levels\r\nGlobal indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the percentage of all Key Biodiversity Areas that are wholly covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"NA"},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"NA"},"regional_aggregates":{"label":"Regional aggregates","content":"UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator. \r\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way for conservation. \r\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\r\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide.

The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest (e.g., forests), it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 15.1.\r\nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.\r\nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of terrestrial and freshwater area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\r\nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011�2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:\r\n- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\r\n- Category Ib: Wilderness area\r\n- Category II: National park\r\n- Category III: Natural monument or feature\r\n- Category IV: Habitat/species management area\r\n- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\r\n- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\r\nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).\r\nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world�s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016)."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.\r\nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to \"green listing\" have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly. \r\nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\", as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011�2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et all. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" are so far still in their infancy. As these are consolidated, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" will be included into the World Database on Protected Areas and thus this indicator accordingly.\r\nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While IBAs have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). \r\nKey Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or \"irreplaceability\") using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).\r\nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of terrestrial and freshwater KBAs through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other methods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2015) and digital polygons for terrestrial and freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool at https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login). Any terrestrial and freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas for which >98% of their area is overlapped by one or more protected areas was defined as completely protected (to allow for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is then computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and multiplying by 100. \r\nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the WDPA, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted (Butchart et al. 2012, 2015)."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including marine (Edgar et al. 2008), freshwater (Holland et al. 2012), and mountains (Rodr�guez-Rodr�guez et al. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2002). The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I�VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\r\nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.1, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets include:\r\nSDG 6.6 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for freshwater biodiversity.\r\nSDG 14.5 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.\r\nSDG 15.4 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for mountain biodiversity.\r\nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world�s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the percentage of all Key Biodiversity Areas that are wholly covered by protected areas.

UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator. \r\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way for conservation. \r\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\r\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas."},"sources_of_discrepancies":{"label":"Sources of discrepancies","content":"National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences between national indicators and the global one.

The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of mountain ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 15.1.\r\nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values.\r\nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of mountain area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.\r\nThe indicator is used to track progress towards the 2011�2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use:\r\n- Category Ia: Strict nature reserve\r\n- Category Ib: Wilderness area\r\n- Category II: National park\r\n- Category III: Natural monument or feature\r\n- Category IV: Habitat/species management area\r\n- Category V: Protected landscape/seascape\r\n- Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources\r\nThe status \"designated\" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military).\r\nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas, that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world�s countries (BirdLife International 2014). The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (Ricketts et al. 2005), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of Key Biodiversity Areas unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems was approved by IUCN (2016)."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Quality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World Database on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies between the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of a manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes apply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.\r\nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an indicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these measures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to \"green listing\" have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly. \r\nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\", as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011�2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important (Jonas et all. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" are so far still in their infancy. As these are consolidated, \"other effective area-based conservation measures\" will be included into the World Database on Protected Areas and thus this indicator accordingly.\r\nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly threatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While IBAs have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et al. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et al. 2007, Foster et al. 2012). \r\nKey Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where comprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or \"irreplaceability\") using systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014).\r\nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of mountain KBAs through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide variety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data on protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of designation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other methods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"This indicator is calculated from data derived from a spatial overlap between digital polygons for protected areas from the World Database on Protected Areas (IUCN & UNEP-WCMC 2015), Key Biodiversity Areas (from the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, including Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, and other Key Biodiversity Areas; available through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool at https://www.ibat-alliance.org/ibat-conservation/login), and mountains (UNEP-WCMC 2002). Any mountain Key Biodiversity Areas for which >98% of their area is overlapped by one or more protected areas was defined as completely protected (to allow for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets). The value of the indicator at a given point in time, based on data on the year of protected area establishment recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas, is then computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and multiplying by 100. \r\nYear of protected area establishment is unknown for 12% of protected areas in the WDPA, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. To reflect this uncertainty, a year was randomly assigned from another protected area within the same country, and then this procedure repeated 1,000 times, with the median plotted (Butchart et al. 2012, 2015)."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels (e.g., Han et al. 2014), or conversely to aggregate to the global level. Key Biodiversity Areas span all ecosystem types, including mountains (Rodr�guez-Rodr�guez et al. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2002). The indicator can therefore be reported in combination across terrestrial and freshwater systems, or disaggregated among them. However, individual Key Biodiversity Areas can encompass terrestrial and freshwater (and indeed marine) systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, the indicator can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I�VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas.\r\nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across important sites for mountain biodiversity as an indicator towards SDG 15.4, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets include:\r\nSDG 6.6 Coverage by protected areas of important sites for freshwater biodiversity.\r\nSDG 14.5 Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas.\r\nSDG 15.1 Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.\r\nProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss (Butchart et al. 2012). Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"Data are available for protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas in all of the world�s countries, and so no imputation or estimation of national level data is necessary."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"Global indicators of protected area coverage of important sites for biodiversity are calculated as the percentage of all Key Biodiversity Areas that are wholly covered by protected areas. The data are generated from all countries, and so while there is uncertainty around the data, there are no missing values as such and so no need for imputation or estimation."},"regional_aggregates":{"label":"Regional aggregates","content":"UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the World Database on Protected Areas and disseminated through Protected Planet. The World Database on Protected Areas and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas. The World Database on Protected Areas is held within a Geographic Information System that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). Protected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in World Database on Protected Areas whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator. \r\nImportant Bird and Biodiversity Areas are sites of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way for conservation. \r\nAlliance for Zero Extinction sites meet three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant (=95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence Alliance for Zero Extinction sites represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species).\r\nThe Important Bird and Biodiversity Area and Alliance for Zero Extinction site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas."},"sources_of_discrepancies":{"label":"Sources of discrepancies","content":"National processes provide the great bulk of the data that are subsequently aggregated into both the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas, and so there are very few differences between national indicators and the global one.

It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1."},"rationale":{"label":"Rationale","content":"The world�s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated.\r\nThe Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as �Least Concern�) to 0 (all species are categorized as �Extinct�), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the Red List Index allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the Red List Index over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted.\r\nThe name \"Red List Index\" should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics (in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled). The Red List Index provides an indicator of trends in species� extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Mace et al. 2008, IUCN 2012a), and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.\r\nThe Red List Index is used as an indicator towards the 2011�2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010) and Millennium Development Goal 7. It can also be projected to assess future development scenarios (Visconti et al. 2015)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The indicator excludes such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007)."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"There are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index values and trends.\r\n(a) Inadequate, incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of a species� status. This uncertainty is minimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and timing.\r\n(b) Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a small (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the Red List Index through back-casting.\r\n(c) Inconsistency between species assessments. These can be minimized by the requirement to provide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, and estimates of uncertainty and data quality, which are checked and standardized by IUCN through Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards and Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the Application of the Categories and Criteria are maintained (IUCN SPSC 2016), as is an online training course (in English, Spanish and French).\r\n(d) Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data Deficient category, and excluded from the calculation of the Red List Index. For birds, only 0.8% of extant species are evaluated as Data Deficient, compared with 24% of amphibians. If Data Deficient species differ in the rate at which their extinction risk is changing, the Red List Index may give a biased picture of the changing extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree of uncertainty this introduces is estimated through a bootstrapping procedure that randomly assigns each Data Deficient species a category based on the numbers of non-Data Deficient species in each Red List category for the set of species under consideration, and repeats this for 1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for the median.\r\nThe main limitation of the Red List Index is related to the fact that the Red List Categories are relatively broad measures of status, and thus the Red List Index for any individual taxonomic group can practically be updated at intervals of at least four years. As the overall index is aggregated across multiple taxonomic groups, it can be updated typically annually. In addition, the Red List Index does not capture particularly well the deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread but are declining slowly."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"The Red List Index is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for �Near Threatened� to 5 for �Extinct� and �Extinct in the Wild�) and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the �Extinct� category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the Red List Index value.\r\nMathematically this calculation is expressed as: \r\nRLIt = 1 � [(Ss Wc(t,s) / (WEX * N)]\r\nWhere Wc(t,s) is the weight for category (c) at time (t) for species (s) (the weight for �Critically Endangered� = 4, �Endangered� = 3, �Vulnerable� = 2, �Near Threatened� = 1, �Least Concern� = 0. �Critically Endangered� species tagged as �Possibly Extinct� or �Possibly Extinct in the Wild� are assigned a weight of 5); WEX = 5, the weight assigned to �Extinct� or �Extinct in the Wild� species; and N is the total number of assessed species, excluding those assessed as Data Deficient in the current time period, and those considered to be �Extinct� in the year the set of species was first assessed.\r\nThe formula requires that:\r\n� Exactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and\r\n� The only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and\r\n� Data Deficient species are excluded.\r\nIn many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the Red List Index until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, Red List Indices are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.\r\nThe methods and scientific basis for the Red List Index were described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010). \r\nButchart et al. (2010) also described the methods by which Red List Indices for different taxonomic groups are aggregated to produce a single multi-taxon Red List Index. Specifically, aggregated Red List Indices are calculated as the arithmetic mean of modelled Red List Indices. Red List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points) to align them with years for which Red List Indices for other taxa are available. The Red List Indices for each taxonomic group for each year are modelled to take into account various sources of uncertainty: \r\ni) Data Deficiency: Red List categories (from Least Concern to Extinct) are assigned to all Data Deficient species, with a probability proportional to the number of species in non-Data Deficient categories for that taxonomic group; \r\nii) Extrapolation uncertainty: although RLIs were extrapolated linearly based on the slope of the closest two assessed point, there is uncertainty about how accurate this slope may be. To incorporate this uncertainty, rather than extrapolating deterministically, the slope used for extrapolation is selected from a normal distribution with a probability equal to the slope of the closest two assessed points, and standard deviation equal to 60% of this slope (i.e., the CV is 60%); \r\niii) Temporal variability: the �true� Red List Index likely changes from year to year, but because assessments are repeated only at multi-year intervals, the precise value for any particular year is uncertain. \r\nTo make this uncertainty explicit, the Red List Index value for a given taxonomic group in a given year is assigned from a moving window of five years, centred on the focal year (with the window set as 3-4 years for the first two and last two years in the series). Note that assessment uncertainty cannot yet be incorporated into the index. Practically, these uncertainties are incorporated into the aggregated Red List Indices as follows: Data Deficient species were allotted a category as described above, and a Red List Index for each taxonomic group was calculated interpolating and extrapolating as described above. A final Red List Index value was assigned to each taxonomic group for each year from a window of years as described above. Each such �run� produced a Red List Index for the complete time period for each taxonomic group, incorporating the various sources of uncertainty. Ten thousand such runs are generated for each taxonomic group, and the mean is calculated.\r\nMethods for generating national disaggregations of the Red List Index are described below."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"The Red List Index can be downscaled to show national and regional Red List Indices, weighted by the fraction of each species� distribution occurring within the country or region, building on the method published by Rodrigues et al. (2014) PLoS ONE 9(11): e113934. These show an index of aggregate survival probability (the inverse of extinction risk) for all birds, mammals, amphibians, corals and cycads occurring within the country or region. The index shows how well species are conserved in a country or region to its potential contribution to global species conservation. The index is calculated as: \r\nRLI(t,u) = 1 � [(Ss(W(t,s) * (rsu/Rs)) / (WEX * Ss (rsu/Rs))\r\nwhere t is the year of comprehensive reassessment, u is the spatial unit (i.e. country), W_((t,s)) is the weight of the global Red List category for species s at time t (Least Concern =0, Near Threatened =1, Vulnerable =2, Endangered =3, Critically Endangered =4, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) =5, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct in the Wild) =5, Extinct in the Wild =5 and Extinct =5), WEX = 5 is the weight for Extinct species, r_su is the fraction of the total range of species s in unit u, and R_s is the total range size of species s.\r\nThe index varies from 1 if the country has contributed the minimum it can to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator is 0 because all species in the country are LC) to 0 if the country has contributed the maximum it can to the global RLI (i.e., if the numerator equals the denominator because all species in the country are Extinct or Possibly Extinct). \r\nThe taxonomic groups included are those in which all species have been assessed for the IUCN Red List more than once. Red List categories for years in which comprehensive assessments (i.e. those in which all species in the taxonomic group have been assessed) were carried out are determined following the approach of Butchart et al. 2007; PLoS ONE 2(1): e140, i.e. they match the current categories except for those taxa that have undergone genuine improvement or deterioration in extinction risk of sufficient magnitude to qualify for a higher or lower Red List category.\r\nThe indicator can also be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, and other political and geographic divisions (e.g., Han et al. 2014), by taxonomic subsets (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2011), by suites of species relevant to particular international treaties or legislation (e.g., Croxall et al. 2012), by suites of species exposed to particular threatening processes (e.g., Butchart 2008), and by suites of species that deliver particular ecosystem services, or have particular biological or life-history traits (e.g., Regan et al. 2015). In each case, information can be obtained from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine which species are relevant to particular subsets (e.g. which occur in particular ecosystems, habitats, and geographic areas of interest).\r\nDisaggregations of the Red List Index are also of particular relevance as indicators towards the following SDG targets (Brooks et al. 2015): SDG 2.4 Red List Index (species used for food and medicine); SDG 2.5 Red List Index (wild relatives and local breeds); SDG 12.2 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart 2008); SDG 12.4 Red List Index (impacts of pollution); SDG 13.1 Red List Index (impacts of climate change); SDG 14.1 Red List Index (impacts of pollution on marine species); SDG 14.2 Red List Index (marine species); SDG 14.3 Red List Index (reef-building coral species) (Carpenter et al. 2008); SDG 14.4 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation on marine species) � an ad hoc joint FAO-IUCN Technical Expert Group is currently working to develop agreed recommendations on the use and interpretation of this indicator; SDG 15.1 Red List Index (terrestrial & freshwater species); SDG 15.2 Red List Index (forest-specialist species); SDG 15.4 Red List Index (mountain species); SDG 15.7 Red List Index (impacts of utilisation) (Butchart 2008); and SDG 15.8 Red List Index (impacts of invasive alien species) (Butchart 2008, McGeoch et al. 2010)."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"Red List Indices for each taxonomic group are interpolated linearly for years between data points and extrapolated linearly (with a slope equal to that between the two closest assessed points, except for corals) back to the earliest time point and forwards to the present for years for which estimates are not available. The start year of the aggregated index is set as ten years before the first assessment year for the taxonomic group with the latest starting point. Corals are not extrapolated linearly because declines are known to have been much steeper subsequent to 1996 (owing to extreme bleaching events) than before. Therefore the rate of decline prior to 1996 is set as the average of the rates for the other taxonomic groups."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"The Red List Index is calculated globally based on assessments of extinction risk of each species included, because many species have distributions which span many countries. Thus, while there is certainly uncertainty around the Red List Index, there are no missing values as such, and so no imputation is necessary."},"regional_aggregates":{"label":"Regional aggregates","content":"The Red List Categories and Criteria are applied for each species on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and are determined globally and provided principally by the Specialist Groups and stand-alone Red List Authorities of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, IUCN Secretariat-led initiatives, the BirdLife International partnership, and the other IUCN Red List partner organizations. The staff of the IUCN Global Species Programme compile, validate, and curate these data, and are responsible for publishing and communicating the results. Each individual species assessment is supported by the application of metadata and documentation standards (IUCN 2013), including classifications of, for example, threats and conservation actions (Salafsky et al. 2008). \r\nRed List assessments are undertaken through either open workshops or through open-access web-based discussion fora. Assessments are reviewed by the appropriate Red List Authority (an individual or organization appointed by the IUCN Species Survival Commission to review assessments for specific species or groups of species) to ensure standardisation and consistency in the interpretation of information and application of the criteria. A Red List Technical Working Group and the IUCN Red List Unit work to ensure consistent categorization between species, groups and assessments. Finally, a Standards and Petitions Sub-committee monitors the process and resolves challenges and disputes over Red List assessments.\r\nIn addition, IUCN publishes guidelines on applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at regional or national scales (IUCN 2012b). Based on these, many countries have initiated programmes to assess the extinction risk of species occurring within their borders. These countries will be able to implement the Red List Index based on national extinction risk, once they have carried out at least two national Red Lists using the IUCN system in a consistent way (Bubb et al. 2009). An increasing number of countries have now completed national Red List Indices for a range of taxa (e.g., G�rdenfors 2010, Pihl & Flensted 2011).\r\nWhile global Red List Indices can be disaggregated to show trends for species at smaller spatial scales, the reverse is not true. National or regional Red List Indices cannot be aggregated to produce Red List Indices showing global trends. This is because a taxon�s global extinction risk has to be evaluated at the global scale and cannot be directly determined from multiple national scale assessments across its range (although the data from such assessments can be aggregated for inclusion in the global assessment)."},"sources_of_discrepancies":{"label":"Sources of discrepancies","content":"Some countries have assessed the national extinction risk of species occurring in the country, and have repeated such assessments, allowing a national Red List Index to be produced. This may differ from the indicator described here because (a) it considers national rather than global extinction risk, and (b) because it takes no account of the national responsibility for the conservation of each species, treating as equal both those species that occur nowhere outside the country (i.e. national endemics) and those with large ranges that occur in many other countries. Any such differences will be smaller for countries within which a high proportion of species are endemic (i.e., only found in that country), as in many island nations and mountainous countries, especially in the tropics.

The more countries with invasive alien species and biosecurity related legislation, the greater the global commitment to controlling the threat to biodiversity from invasive alien species. The larger the number of invasive alien species -relevant international policies, and the greater the level of national commitment to these, the greater the global commitment to controlling invasive alien species. The more international agreements a country is party to the more strongly committed the country is to controlling invasive alien species.\r\nThe global trend in policy response has been positive for the few last decades and, since the publication of GBO3, the adoption of policies against invasive alien species has significantly increased. As reported in 2010, 55% of the 191 countries that are Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity have overarching national legislation to prevent, control and/or limit the spread and impact of invasive alien species, and most Convention on Biological Diversity Parties were signatory to at least one of ten other multilateral agreements that cover invasive alien species in some form. Among these countries, 8% are signatory to all 10 international agreements (McGeoch et al. 2010). \r\nFor example, the Council of Europe has been developing and adopting codes of conduct addressing some key pathways (e.g. horticulture, botanic gardens, zoos, hunting, or fishing) of invasive alien species. Moreover, once the European regulation on invasive alien species is fully adopted, it will have major implications for neighbouring countries, but also at a world scale, as the European institution is a major partner for global trade.\r\nThe projection of the current trend of adoption of national policies on invasive alien species projects a nonsignificant increase by 2020, with a slowing of the rate of increase in the proportion of countries adopting such legislation. The adoption of national and international policies on invasive alien species is a first step to combatting the spread of invasive alien species.\r\nThe indicator is maintained by the IUCN Species Survival Commission�s Invasive Species Specialist Group.\r\nThis indicator is utilised for assessing progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020: \"by 2020, invasive alien species and pathways are identified and prioritized, priority species are controlled or eradicated, and measures are in place to manage pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment\" (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Biological Diversity�s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)."},"concepts":{"label":"Concepts","content":"An alien species is a species introduced by humans � either intentionally or accidentally � outside of its natural past or present distribution.

This is due to the fact that these face-to-face survey projects can be expensive in some countries and hence due to budget limitations, the World Bank hasn�t been able to update some of the Enterprise Surveys data in a subset of countries. Another limitation is that the surveys are done mostly in World Bank client countries and hence most high-income countries are not covered by the surveys (US, Canada, Western European countries, Japan, GCC countries, etc.).\r\nAnother limitation may be the sensitive nature of corruption. In some countries/cultures, firms may not be comfortable answering questions on corruption.

There are seven Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Performance pillars containing a total of 31 indicators. The pillar containing this indicator is part of Pillar I which measures Budget reliability."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"Although not all countries have used the methodology on an annual basis for this indicator, the methodology relies on standard data sets for approved and final budget outturns which are commonly produced at least annually in every country. The countries that have not used the methodology to date are primarily highly developed countries which would have less difficulty in providing the necessary data than those in the lower and middle income categories that have been primary users of Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) to date.\r\nOne limitation of the indicator is that it is an aggregate indicator of budget reliability. While it can be disaggregated across regions, it is not disaggregated across various budget subcomponents. Different indicators are used for assessing changes in expenditure composition in the PEFA framework. Also, while this indicator is intended to measure budget reliability it should be understood that actual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of forecasts�for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. However, the calibration of this indicator accommodates one unusual or \"outlier\" year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which occur in two of the three years covered by the assessment. Therefore, single year shocks are discounted allowing a more balanced assessment.\r\nThe broader context in which the indicator was developed is as follows. PEFA is a tool for assessing the status of public financial management and reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of Public Financial Management (PFM). A PEFA assessment provides a thorough, consistent and evidence-based analysis of PFM performance at a specific point in time and can be reapplied in successive assessments to track changes over time. The PEFA framework provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of countries� PFM systems using 31 performance indicators that are further disaggregated into 94 dimensions. A PEFA assessment measures the extent to which PFM systems, processes and institutions contribute to the achievement of desirable budget outcomes: aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of resources, and efficient service delivery."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"The methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet (titled \"En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp Calculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls)\") on the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework). It is also detailed in part 2 of the document \"Framework for assessing public financial management\" (https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf).\r\nScoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, C, or D, according to precise criteria: \r\n(A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.\r\n(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.\r\n(C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years.\r\n(D) Performance is less than required for a C score.\r\nIn order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the scoring requirements must be fulfilled. If the requirements are only partly met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given that coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance rating. A score of C reflects the basic level of performance for each indicator and dimension, consistent with good international practices. A score of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the basic level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient information to score the dimension.\r\nThe D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level. �D� is applied if the performance observed is less than required for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when sufficient information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A score of D due to insufficient information is distinguished from D scores for low-level performance by the use of an asterisk�that is, D* at the dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level.\r\nThe coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for three consecutive years as a basis for assessment.

There are three possible types of accreditation: \r\nA: Compliance with Paris Principles \r\nB: Observer Status � Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination \r\nC: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles \r\nAccreditation by the GANHRI entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. Other international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems.\r\nThe Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles) adopted by General Assembly, Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993 provide the international benchmarks against which NHRIs can be accredited by the GANHRI."},"comments_and_limitations":{"label":"Comments and limitations","content":"The important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights has been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final Document and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA resolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been encouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 �affirms the priority that should be accorded to the development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective implementation of international human rights standards� while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 encouraged states �to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions�. The Human Rights Council (HRC resolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its institution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work. \r\nUN treaty bodies have also recognized the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective implementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, A/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, CRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to NHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: http://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/. \r\nThe GANHRI is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted documents such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered in its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential decree, 2) outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of recent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. NHRIs that hold �A� and �B� status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organizations may also provide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter. \r\nAccreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However their effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of their human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the NHRI to the recommendations of the GANHRI. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with the international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, and to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their mandate in reference to international human rights instruments."}},"methodology":{"computation_method":{"label":"Computation Method","content":"In terms of method of computation, the indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of the NHRI."},"disaggregation":{"label":"Disaggregation","content":"While disaggregation of information is not applicable for this indicator, it may be desirable to highlight the type of NHRI, whether Ombudsman, human rights commission, advisory body, research-based institute, etc."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_country_level":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at country level","content":"All country data are available and there is no Treatment of missing values."},"treatment_of_missing_values_at_regional_and_global_levels":{"label":"Treatment of missing values at regional and global levels","content":"All country data are available and there is no Treatment of missing values."},"regional_aggregates":{"label":"Regional aggregates","content":"NA"},"sources_of_discrepancies":{"label":"Sources of discrepancies","content":"The country counterpart has the possibility to appeal the decision on the level of compliance with the Paris Principles received from the international mechanism.

Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid activity.
